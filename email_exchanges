I hereby request the following records:\nThe initiating and terminating documents for all 161 files (Special Inquiries for White House, Congressional Committees and Other Government Agencies) opened or closed in 2002. In addition to this, I request the first 10 other releasable pages and the last 10 other releasable pages from each file and the first and last instance releasable instances of communications from the White House, Congressional Committees or Other Government Agencies as appropriate. As 161 files, like all FBI files, are numbered chronologically based on the order they are opened, the process to find files opened in 2002 is simple and straightforward, and therefore well within the bounds of a \"reasonable search\" even if it the search interface doesn't allow this process to be instantly automated.\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
