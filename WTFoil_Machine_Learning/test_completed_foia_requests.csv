The aggregate number of detections collected during 2017. 
The aggregate number of “hits” (i.e. times that a plate on a hotlist was detected) during 2016. 
The aggregate number of “hits” during 2017.

This information is easily available within the Agency’s LEARN system. The simplest way to extract this data is to generate a “Dashboard Hit Ratio Report” PDF file from within LEARN. We would prefer the data for each year to be provided separately.

Brigitte Tudor, better known as Brigitte Gabriel, founded ACT for America in 2007 at a time when the anti-Muslim movement America was beginning to take shape in the United States. In the years since, the group has grown to become the largest grassroots anti-Muslim group in America, claiming 280,000 members and over 1,000 chapters. Brigitte Gabriel claims ACT was launched as a response to the 9/11 attacks and “educates citizens and elected officials to impact policy involving national security and defeating terrorism.” Throughout its existence, ACT has stayed true to its mission by working to advance anti-Muslim legislation at the local and federal level while flooding the American public with wild hate speech demonizing Muslims.

Even before she created ACT, Gabriel, a Lebanese Christian who national turned American citizen, was vocally critical of Islam and Muslims and repeatedly made statements conflating all Muslims with terrorists. “Islamic terrorists … are really just very devout followers of Muhammad,” she wrote in 2006. “They are following his example and doing exactly what the Koran teaches and their mullahs exhort them to do.” In 2004, she angered a Jewish audience during a speech in which she reportedly referred to Arabs as “barbarians,” prompting a public apology from her hosts. In 2006 Gabriel released Because They Hate: A Survivor of Islamic Terror Warns America. The book was a call to action based on the “truth” behind Islam that Gabriel says she learned as a child during the civil war in Lebanon.

In 2007, Gabriel gave a lecture to the Defense Department’s Joint Forces Staff College as part a course on Islam. She reportedly told U.S. military and national security personnel that Muslims should be prohibited from serving in public office on the basis of their faith. “If a Muslim who has — who is — a practicing Muslim who believes the word of the Koran to be the word of Allah, who abides by Islam, who goes to mosque and prays every Friday, who prays five times a day — this practicing Muslim, who believes in the teachings of the Koran, cannot be a loyal citizen to the United States of America,” she said.

In 2008, a year after forming ACT, Gabriel published a second book, They Must Be Stopped: Why We Must Defeat Radical Islam and How We Can Do It.  A line from the book’s introduction read, “In the Muslim world, extreme is mainstream.”

In 2010, as the number of ACT chapters and members increased, the organization announced its first “National Conference and Legislative Briefing” which took place from that June in Washington, D.C. The conference brought together anti-Muslim leaders, ACT chapter activists and federal politicians to discuss concerns with Islam and Muslims under the guise of protecting national security. The legislative briefing segment of the conference was another indication of ACT’s budding ties with elected officials, with many of them talking time out of their schedules to talk to ACT members about pressing national security topics. At the 2010 conference, ACT presented its “Patriot Award” to U.S. Rep. Peter King of New York a champion of the anti-Muslim cause.

When presenting Rep. King with the award, Gabriel indicated how much ACT covets its relationships with elected officials and how critical they are to advancing ACT’s agenda. Gabriel told King, “I cannot tell you how much we appreciate you and how much we are dedicated to making your work on Capitol Hill easier by mobilizing the people and the public, especially in your state, to support you.” King responded, “I want you to know, as I said before, how much I appreciate the work that ACT for America does for our country. Because we are engaged in a brutal war against a brutal enemy, the enemy of Islamic terrorism, and so many people in our country choose to look the other way, so many people in our country choose to ignore it, so many people choose to be politically correct.”

At the federal level, like its membership base, ACT’s national conferences continued to swell in attendance and stature. In 2013, for example, one of the speakers at ACT’s conference was disgraced former FBI agent John Gundolo. Guandolo joined the FBI’s counterterrorism division in the wake of 9/11, but by 2005 he was posing as a driver for a “star witness” in the corruption case of former Congressman William Jefferson (D-LA). He made “inappropriate sexual advances” to that witness and soon was having an “intimate relationship…that he thought could damage an investigation,” according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune He also unsuccessfully solicited the witness for a $75,000 donation to an organization he supported and carried on extramarital affairs with female FBI agents.

Guandolo’s actions risked ruining the government’s prosecution of Jefferson, and he faced an investigation by the bureau's Office of Professional Responsibility. Though he later expressed “deep remorse” for his actions, he resigned from the bureau in December 2008 ahead of an internal. Later that month, he became a full-time counterterrorism expert often spreading anti-Muslim ideas and conspiracy theories.

According to his resume, that month Guandolo became Vice President of the Strategic Engagement Group, a  tiny consultancy advertised as the “only company in the United States aimed at identifying potential threats to homeland security.” He currently travels the country training law enforcement on counter-terror techniques and speaks at various events, including the 2013 Writers Workshop organized by the anti-immigrant  Social Contract Press, which regularly publishes white nationalist authors.

Guandolo’s presentation at ACT’s 2013 national conference unveiled one of ACT’s most disturbing endeavors to date: the Thin Blue Line project, billed as a “one-stop internet resource for information concerning the perceived threat of Muslim infiltration and terrorism in the country.” Its key component is a “Radicalization Map Locator,” listing the addresses of almost every Muslim Student Association (MSA) in the country as well as a number of mosques and Islamic institutions– all listed as suspected national security concerns. Just this year, Guandolo told a crowd in South Carolina that the sole purpose of MSA’s is to “recruit jihadis.”

At the federal level, ACT identifies national security bills which it deems “high priority legislation” and requests that its members encourage elected officials to support it. Some of the bills are introduced by legislators very sympathetic to the ACT cause, such as U.S. Reps. Steve King of Iowa and Trent Franks of Arizona.

ACT’s 2015 conference listed no fewer than fifteen elected federal officials as speakers, with part of the event taking place at the Capitol . Despite its hateful rhetoric towards Muslims, ACT’s efforts to build relationships with elected officials has been effective –– both on a federal and state level.   

In 2008, ACT began a campaign called Stop Shariah Now. According to the Stop Shariah Now website, the project aimed “to inform and educate the public about what Shariah is, how it is creeping into American society and compromising our constitutional freedom of speech, press, religion and equality what we can do to stop it.” In an interview with the Center for American Progress (CAP), then ACT staffer Chris Slick detailed how ACT worked closely with Frank Gaffney, head of the anti-Muslim think tank Center for Security Policy (CSP), to push anti-Shariah legislation at the state level.  

The anti-Shariah laws were drafted by CSP’s general counsel, David Yerushalmi, who equates Shariah with Islamic extremism and advocates criminalizing virtually any personal practice compliant with Shariah. In his view, only a Muslim who fully breaks with the customs of Shariah can be considered socially tolerable.

In early 2012, together with Robert Muise of the Thomas More Law Center, Yerushalmi formed the American Freedom Law Center (AFLC) and began pushing an “American Laws for American Courts” initiative to push a model anti-Shariah law, drafted primarily by Yerushalmi, in legislatures across the country. The bill argued that America has “unique values of liberty and freedom” that do not exist in foreign legal systems like Shariah law.

Legal experts call such anti-Shariah measures superfluous because there is no mechanism by which any foreign criminal or civil code can trump U.S. laws. By the summer of 2013, however, anti-foreign law measures had passed in Arizona, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Tennessee and North Carolina. The bills are still being introduced in states such as South Carolina in 2016.

The group has not only been active on a legislative level. In 2010, ACT targeted a Muslim professor serving on a human rights board in Florida, accusing him of having ties to radical Islamic groups and serving as a “mosque operative” in city government.

After months of opposition to Parvez Ahmed’s nomination to the Human Rights Commission of Jacksonville — he was appointed in 2010 — ACT held a news conference on the steps of Jacksonville City Hall to release a DVD containing highly edited clips of a speech Ahmed gave in October 2010, which the group claims shows “irrefutable” evidence of Ahmed’s associations with the Muslim Brotherhood and radical Islam — despite the absence of any footage speaking directly to that charge. The lack of evidence apparently didn’t trouble Randy McDaniels, the ACT chapter leader in Jacksonville who called the news conference. “It’s how he says what he says. What he doesn’t say. What’s inferred and the facts we know,” McDaniels said, adding that Ahmed was a “made man in the Muslim mafia.”

ACT’s campaign to discredit Ahmed went on for months. Activists claiming to be ACT members disrupted his public appearances, screaming that he belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood. Ahmed described being harassed at one public appearance to the point that audience members, fearing for his safety, escorted him from the room. Another eyewitness confirmed Ahmed’s account.

As ACT continued to develop a large grassroots base, it shifted focus to targeting public education. In 2012, ACT’s education arm released a lengthy report titled, “Education or Indoctrination? The Treatment of Islam in 6th through 12th Grade American Textbooks.” The report examined 38 textbooks for how Islam was depicted and concluded, “Perhaps the greatest disservice done to students is the net effect of the accumulation of these  errors –– the  creation  of  a  faulty  historical  narrative  that  not  only  misrepresents Islam  but  creates  an  inaccurate comparison between  Islam,  Christianity  and  Judaism, and  between  the  Muslim  world  and  the  West. Regardless  of  the  issue–slavery, conquest and imperialism, the Crusades, the Arab-Israeli conflict, to name a few–Islam30and the Muslim world are not generally held to the same rigor of historical analysis that the textbooks apply to Christianity, Judaism and the West.”

The report recommended that ACT activists take the textbook fight to their local school boards and many heeded the call. The founder of ACT’s Birmingham, Ala., chapter, Larry Houck, was ultimately unsuccessful in his attempts to remove 11 textbooks from state schools due to their alleged bias in favor of Islam. In January 2014, the Alabama school board voted 5-2 to approve the textbooks, much to the chagrin of Houck who wrote a letter to the board asking ""Why is so much text devoted to Islam?"" and claiming the books ""proselytize for Islam."" Despite its best efforts, the “Textbook Project” has been resoundingly unsuccessful.

ACT’s increasing popularity is due, in part, to Gabriel’s tactic of forging relationships with the American Christian right. Gabriel hired Guy Rodgers to serve as ACT’s executive director and this turned out to be a shrewd move. Rodgers brought with him a wealth of contacts from his time with the Christian Coalition, a group The New York Times has referred to to as “the most potent political organization on the Christian right.” The Coalition was created in 1989 by televangelist Pat Robertson, a rabid anti-gay activist who is also known for espousing conspiracy theories involving Jewish bankers and Freemasons.

Gabriel has a past relationship with Robertson, working as an anchor for one of his television programs when she resided in the Middle East. Rogers left ACT in 2014 and a year later the group claims 280,000 members and almost 900 chapters, spanning 11 countries.

In 2015, like many of the major anti-Muslim groups in the U.S., ACT began openly targeting Syrian refugees, launching a Refugee Resettlement Working Group that aims to make sure that, “potential terrorists are kept on the outside looking in” by attempting to stop Syrian refugee relocation in locales around the U.S.

ACT has a long history of targeting refugees. In 2011, ACT helped to pass anti-refugee legislation in Tennessee. Four years later, in email to supporters, ACT announced plans to take this effort to as many states of possible. “We are happy to announce that we will soon be working to see similar, enhanced, legislation of this nature introduced and passed in all 50 state legislatures,” an ACT alert announced. The anti-Muslim think tank Center for Security Policy is also working on this fight, but at the country rather than state level.

To boost its anti-refugee efforts, ACT also began cultivating a relationship with Ann Corcoran, the face of the anti-refugee movement in America and head of the website Refugee Resettlement Watch (RRW). Corcoran founded the blog in 2007 in response to what she saw as a “grievous error” by the government in taking in Muslim refugees.

Gabriel invited Corcoran to speak at ACT’s 2015 national conference where one of the main topics discussed was opposition to Syrian refugees. Before the conference, Gabriel wrote about how her organization is “thrilled” to have Corcoran speaking at the event. Gabriel herself has used her recent speaking engagements to attack draw the link between Syrian refugees and ISIS. In February of 2016, Montana ACT activists participated in an rally in opposition a proposal to open a refugee resettlement office in Missoula, Montana.

Alger Hiss (November 11, 1904 – November 15, 1996) was an American government official who was accused of being a Soviet spy in 1948 and convicted of perjury in connection with this charge in 1950. Before he was tried and convicted, he was involved in the establishment of the United Nations both as a U.S. State Department official and as a U.N. official. In later life he worked as a lecturer and author.

On August 3, 1948, Whittaker Chambers, a former U.S. Communist Party member, testified under subpoena before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) that Hiss had secretly been a Communist while in federal service. Called before HUAC, Hiss categorically denied the charge. When Chambers repeated his claim on nationwide radio, Hiss filed a defamation lawsuit against him.

During the pretrial discovery process, Chambers produced new evidence indicating that he and Hiss had been involved in espionage, which both men had previously denied under oath to HUAC. A federal grand jury indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury; Chambers admitted to the same offense but, as a cooperating government witness, was never charged. Although Hiss's indictment stemmed from the alleged espionage, he could not be tried for that crime because the statute of limitations had expired. After a mistrial due to a hung jury, Hiss was tried a second time. In January 1950, he was found guilty on both counts of perjury and received two concurrent five-year sentences, of which he eventually served three and a half years. Hiss maintained his innocence until his death.

Arguments about the case and the validity of the verdict took center stage in broader debates about the Cold War, McCarthyism, and the extent of Soviet espionage in the United States. Since Hiss's conviction, statements by involved parties and newly exposed evidence have added to the dispute. Author Anthony Summers argued that since many relevant files continue to be unavailable, the Hiss controversy will continue to be debated. In 2001, James Barron, a staff reporter for The New York Times, identified what he called a ""growing consensus that Hiss, indeed, had most likely been a Soviet agent.",,FALSE,1068,1063,Subjects Matter: FBI Files,,0.00,2018-07-14 16:18:22.091295+00:00,2018-08-10,,alger-hiss-58202

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).

As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.

Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

EmmaBest,American Family Association (AFA),Completed,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/american-family-association-afa-31213/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning American Family Association (AFA). The American Family Association (AFA) says it promotes ""traditional moral values"" in media. A large part of that work involves ""combating the homosexual agenda"" through various means, including publicizing companies that have pro-gay policies and organizing boycotts against them. 

Initially founded as the National Federation for Decency, the American Family Association (AFA) originally focused on what it considered indecent television programming and pornography. The AFA says it promotes ""traditional moral values"" in media. A large part of that work involves ""combating the homosexual agenda"" through various means, including publicizing companies that have pro-gay policies and organizing boycotts against them. The AFA has a variety of outlets to disseminate its message, including the American Family Radio Network, its online One News Now and the monthly AFA Journal. In early 2011, the AFA claimed more than 2 million online supporters and 180,000 subscribers to its Journal.

Founded in 1977 by Methodist minister Donald E. Wildmon as the National Federation for Decency, the American Family Association (AFA) worked in its early years to remove what it considered indecent programming from television. Its other major focus was battling pornography. In 1988, the group's name was changed to the AFA, because the organization's concerns, Wildmon said in 2007, had expanded.

In 1985, Wildmon was appointed to former Attorney General Ed Meese's Commission on Pornography by its director, Alan Sears, who later would become president of the Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian-based legal organization. Wildmon successfully orchestrated the removal of Playboy and Penthouse from some 17,000 convenience stores. Also in the 1980s, Wildmon started ramping up the AFA's anti-LGBT propaganda and succeeded in getting some corporations to pull their ads from shows like ""Thirtysomething,"" which had been added to Wildmon's list of ""Trash TV"" because its plot included a gay romance.

Wildmon has never made a secret of his anti-LGBT views. One of his statements on the AFA's website reads, ""I never dreamed I would see the day when sodomy would be called normal, and those who held to traditional values based on Christian teaching would be called bigots."" According to the AFA, the primary goal of the ""homosexual movement"" is to ""abolish the traditional, Judeo-Christian view of human sexuality, marriage, and family.""

The AFA has been extremely vocal over the years in its opposition to LGBT rights, marriage equality and allowing gay men and lesbians to serve in the military. The group's arguments are filled with claims that equate homosexuality with pedophilia and argue that there's a ""homosexual agenda"" afoot that is set to bring about the downfall of American (and ultimately, Western) civilization. In one October 2004 article, the AFA Journal suggested that gay influences are leading to a ""grotesque culture"" that will include ""quick encounters in the middle school boys' restroom.""

For years, until 2010, the AFA had a section on its website that supposedly exposed ""The Homosexual Agenda."" There, a reader could find articles and other AFA publications that claimed LGBT people were trying to force the acceptance of homosexuality on children through sex education programs in schools; condemned companies like Disney for supporting LGBT rights and programming; and, also until 2010, featured a particularly noxious booklet the AFA had published in 1994. That booklet, Homosexuality in America: Exposing the Myths, included the bogus research of thoroughly discredited psychologist Paul Cameron as a source. One of the publication's authors, Richard Howe, used Cameron's ""research"" to claim that LGBT people don't live as long as heterosexuals, that they're more promiscuous and that the ""disgusting details of the homosexual lifestyle explain why so many diseases are present in the homosexual community."" Another claim was that ""[p]rominent homosexual leaders and publications have voiced support for pedophilia, incest, sadomasochism, and even bestiality.""

In 1998, in what would become a scandal for the group, the AFA signed on to a huge television and newspaper ""ex-gay"" campaign called ""Truth in Love,"" a project that advocated an idea popular in religious-right circles: that LGBT people can be ""cured"" so that they become heterosexual. A man named Michael Johnston was the star of the campaign. In one television ad shot with his mother present, Johnston discussed ""leaving homosexuality"" and was open about his HIV-positive status. Previously, Johnston had worked with Jerry Falwell as an ex-gay leader and done a ""Truth in Love"" commercial for Coral Ridge Ministries. He had also started his own ex-gay ministry, Kerusso, in 1989. Johnston was extremely active on the ex-gay circuit, and was the founder of ""Coming out of Homosexuality Day"" (which coincides with National Coming Out Day).

In 2000, Johnston's story was made available as a film by the AFA, titled ""It's Not Gay."" In the film, he is joined by other ex-gay activists who load the film with unsupported statistics, like ""80% of homosexual men have a sexually transmitted disease."" One of the other ex-gay activists in the film, Richard Cohen, has been discredited for his ""healing touch"" therapy, in which grown men are cradled and held like babies to get used to ""appropriate male touch"" and to ""re-create the father-son bond."" A broken father-son bond, Cohen claims, can ""cause"" homosexuality. In other ""therapy"" sessions, Cohen has clients beat pillows with tennis racquets while blaming their mothers for making them gay.

Three years later, in 2003, news outlets reported that Johnston, while traveling around the country decrying ""the homosexual lifestyle,"" was hosting orgies, taking drugs and having unprotected sex with other men without disclosing his HIV status. In the publicity and accusations that ensued, Johnston shut down his ministry and sought refuge at a live-in facility with Pure Life Ministries in Dry Ridge, Ky. As of 2011, Johnston was listed as Pure Life's director of donor and media relations. He states in his bio that in 2002 he ""was living a completely double life"" and is ""now walking in true freedom.""

The AFA, meanwhile, admitted that Johnston had ""relapsed."" In early 2007, Wayne Besen of ex-gay watchdog group Truth Wins Out, filed complaints with two attorneys general against the AFA and another anti-gay group, Americans for Truth About Homosexuality, for promoting and selling ""It's Not Gay,"" which Besen called ""deceptive."" The AFA addressed Besen's complaints in an article in its March 2007 AFA Journal. Buddy Smith, AFA executive assistant then, claimed that the AFA had stopped selling ""It's Not Gay"" as a result of the scandal. But in 2005, the AFA started selling the DVD again, after meeting with Johnston at Pure Life. Smith stated that the AFA felt confident then ""that Michael had been fully restored and was walking in victory."" The DVD is still available on the AFA's website, without any mention of the scandal. It is described as ""a fair and balanced approach to this challenging subject.""

The AFA's fundraising appeals are known for their shrillness. One mailer from the early 2000s read: ""For the sake of our children and society, we must OPPOSE the spread of homosexual activity! Just as we must oppose murder, stealing, and adultery!"" It continued, ""Since homosexuals cannot reproduce, the only way for them to ‘breed' is to RECRUIT! And who are their targets for recruitment? Children!"" In other appeals, the AFA has used a standard propaganda ploy against LGBT individuals: They're a danger to children.

In the summer of 2010, the AFA announced a boycott of Home Depot stores because Home Depot allegedly supports the ""homosexual agenda."" The AFA said that the home repair chain was ""deliberately exposing children to lascivious displays of sexual conduct by homosexuals"" through its support of pride parades.

The AFA has had very active state chapters, many of which have served as training grounds for anti-gay activists like Scott Lively, founder of the anti-gay hate group Abiding Truth Ministries. Lively, a former director of the AFA's California chapter, claimed in his discredited 1995 co-authored book The Pink Swastika that Germany's Nazi Party was full of gay men who were primarily responsible for the Holocaust. In 2007, Lively co-founded the virulent anti-gay group Watchmen on the Walls, which is particularly popular in Eastern European countries and among some Eastern European immigrants to the United States.

Gary Glenn, current president of the AFA's Michigan chapter, maintains a ""Homosexual Agenda"" link on the AFA-MI website. He has called anti-bullying legislation a way to indoctrinate children – and, by extension, American society – with ""the homosexual agenda"" (a common claim used by the anti-gay right). He has claimed that gay soldiers would cause disease in the military's ranks through ""battlefield blood transfusions"" and that gay soldiers are responsible for high rates of sexual assault in the military.

In 2009, the AFA hired Bryan Fischer, the former executive director of the AFA-affiliated Idaho Values Alliance, as its director of issue analysis for government and public policy and as a radio host. Taking a page from Lively's book, Fischer claimed on his radio show in May 2010 that Hitler chose homosexual soldiers as his elite officers because they were far more brutal and savage than heterosexual soldiers. In defense of that show, Fischer wrote that ""homosexuality gave us Adolph Hitler, and homosexuals in the military gave us the Brown Shirts, the Nazi war machine and six million dead Jews."" He also called for criminalizing gay sex in a February 2010 blog post – because doing so would ensure that ""controversies"" over ""gays in the military"" and ""gay indoctrination in the schools"" would end. He has also advocated forcing gay people into ex-gay therapy, which supposedly can ""cure"" their condition, because homosexuality should be treated in the same way as intravenous drug use. ""Both,"" he told radio host Alan Colmes, ""are equally dangerous and risky to human health."" By August 2010, the AFA had appended a disclaimer to Fischer's posts, stating that his opinions are his own.

That didn't stop Fischer's outrageous postings. In early 2011, Fischer called for an end to Muslim recruits in the U.S. military and an end to Muslim immigration to the U.S. At around the same time, he claimed that Native Americans remained mired in poverty because they refused to accept Christianity. The outcry over that blog post was so great that the AFA actually took it down. A week later, Fischer published a blog item stating that Native Americans should have followed Pocahontas' lead, because she had accepted ""the superior culture"" of the new arrivals to the New World.

Two months after the AFA removed Fischer’s post about Native Americans, he lambasted welfare programs, singling out African Americans for criticism by stating, “Welfare has destroyed the African-American family by telling young black women that husbands and fathers are unnecessary and obsolete. Welfare has subsidized illegitimacy by offering financial rewards to women who have more children out of wedlock. We have incentivized fornication rather than marriage, and it’s no wonder we are now awash in the disastrous social consequences of people who rut like rabbits.”

Once again, the AFA stepped in, but this time Fischer’s post was merely reworded, so that the last sentence of that paragraph now says “… and it’s no wonder we are now awash in the disastrous social consequences of those who engage in random and reckless promiscuity whether they are Caucasian, Hispanic, or African-American.”

In September 2012, however, Fischer said of African-American supporters of the Democratic Party: “They’re like drug-addled addicts and the Democrat Party has gotten them addicted to welfare benefits. That apparently is the only reason they continue to support this party.” And in August 2012, he claimed that if Obama were re-elected, the Department of Homeland Security was ready to use its ammunition against American citizens. He further warned that, “you’re going to hear some serious talk about secession in any number of places around America.”

Currently, the AFA is under the direction of Tim Wildmon, the son of Don Wildmon, who stepped down after 33 years, citing health problems. Tim Wildmon continues the group’s long tradition of anti-gay propagandizing and activism. Wildmon criticized Obama for including gay fathers in his 2010 Father’s Day proclamation, stating in a press release that it was the first time in history a president had used the day to “promote a radical homosexual agenda” and that he was putting the “twisted sexual desires of adults” ahead of children.

Earlier in 2012, Wildmon had notorious anti-gay pastor Patrick Wooden, along with the FRC’s Tony Perkins, on the AFA’s “Today’s Issues” segment of their American Family Radio (AFR). Both Perkins and Wildmon expressed admiration for Wooden, who is perhaps best known for claiming that gay men have to wear diapers or “butt plugs” because they lose control of their bowels. He has also called homosexuality “deviant,” “immoral,” and “anti-human.”

Buster Wilson, the general manager of AFR and host of the program “AFA Today,” suggested in 2012 that God might have sent Hurricane Isaac as punishment for a New Orleans LGBT festival and also tried to link the repeal of DADT to increased suicides, alcoholism, sexual assaults, and violence in the military. Wilson, a conspiracy theorist and member of the antigovernment “Patriot” group Oathkeepers, has also floated the idea that the Department of Homeland Security is buying millions of rounds of ammunition and possibly planning war against American civilians.

My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.",1363745-000,FALSE,1636,1517,"Haters: Documenting Extremist and Hate Groups,Subjects Matter: FBI Files",,0.00,2016-12-23 05:00:00+00:00,2017-01-25,2017-04-21 00:00:00+00:00,american-family-association-afa-31213

EmmaBest,Aryan Brotherhood,Completed,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/aryan-brotherhood-31215/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning The Aryan Brotherhood, also known as The Brand, Alice Baker, AB or One-Two, which is the nation’s oldest major white supremacist prison gang and a national crime syndicate. Founded in 1964 by Irish bikers as a form of protection for white inmates in newly desegregated prisons, the AB is today the largest and deadliest prison gang in the United States, with an estimated 20,000 members inside prisons and on the streets.

Its motto is simple – “blood in, blood out.” AB chapters can be found in most major federal and state prisons in the country. As a crime syndicate, the AB participates in drug trafficking, male prostitution rings, gambling, and extortion inside prison walls. On the streets, the AB is involved in practically every kind of criminal enterprise, including murder-for-hire, armed robbery, gun running, methamphetamine manufacturing, heroin sales, counterfeiting and identity theft.

When officials began to desegregate state and federal prisons during the 1960s, black and white inmates were thrown up against each other in many cases for the first time, and violent conflicts resulted. The Aryan Brotherhood was formed at the San Quentin State Prison in California in 1964, organizing defensively against a violent black prison gang, the Black Guerilla Family, and becoming the first major white supremacist prison gang in the country in the process. Its original membership was largely Irish bikers who initially called themselves the Diamond Tooth Gang because members wore shards of glass in their teeth. But after merging with other white cliques in San Quentin, they renamed themselves the AB. Today, the gang operates both inside and outside prisons, and although it clearly has a white supremacist ideology, it is above all a criminal enterprise. Given the choice between making money and showing their racism, members virtually always go for the cash, meaning the gang has often worked with Latino and other gangs for profit.

Before joining the AB, potential recruits are required to “make their bones,” usually by attacking or murdering a rival gang member or assaulting a corrections officer (thus the “blood in” part of the gang’s motto; “blood out” indicates that once a person is part of the gang, the only way out is death). Inductees have been required to read Hitler’s Mein Kampf and, often, Sun Tzu’s The Art of War and Machiavelli’s The Prince. Many members practice Asatru, a neo-Pagan variant of pre-Christian Odinism that dates back to the Vikings and their Norse gods. Its adherents see themselves as ancient Viking warriors destined for Valhalla.

During the early 1970s, the California Department of Corrections noticed a startling increase in gang-related and racially motivated violence. Although the AB was not responsible for all of the reported deaths and assaults, it quickly earned a reputation for its “zero-tolerance” policy on “disrespect” from other inmates. At the same time, the AB signed on to a truce with another notorious racist prison gang, the Mexican Mafia (or “La Eme”), in that group’s battle with La Nuestra Familia, a Latino gang — early evidence that AB was more interested in profit than ideological purity.

By 1975, the Aryan Brotherhood had expanded into most California state prisons, where something of a race war was being waged. Within two years, moreover, as a number of high-ranking AB leaders were sent to federal prison, the group had seized the opportunity to begin to expand into the federal penitentiary system. As a result, the organization divided into the California AB and the federal system AB. “They’re like two related but different crime families,” said one former top AB leader. “They each have their [ruling] commission … but they’re allies.” At the same time, the group was growing. While there were fewer than 100 members in the late 1970s, hundreds more were recruited in following years, sometimes by swallowing whole racist skinhead gangs. Today, according to officials, there are a total of about 20,000 AB members, with large numbers present in both state and federal prisons.

In its early days, the Aryan Brotherhood employed a “one man, one vote” policy.  This changed in the early 1980s after it became clear this policy was causing chaos within the organization. Both the federal and state prison gang factions implemented a hierarchical structure similar to that of the military. A 12-man council was sworn in with a majority vote. A three-man commission oversaw the council. Michael Thompson served on the California council, while Barry “Barron” Mills, T.D. Bingham and John Greschner (before he quit the group in 1999 and began talking about it to investigators and others) oversaw the federal operation. Tightening the command structure made the gang more powerful and more dangerous.

On Oct. 22, 1983, AB member Tommy Silverstein stabbed corrections officer Merle E. Clutts to death in the Marion, Ohio, federal penitentiary with the help of another inmate. Hours after Clutts was murdered, another AB member, Clayton Fountain, stabbed corrections officer Robert Hoffman and assaulted two other officers because he did not want Silverstein to have a higher body count than him. At the time, the Marion facility was believed to be the most secure federal prison in the country. In response to the incident, federal prisons across the country began to move known AB members to “supermax” units or prisons around the country. These inmates were typically held in solitary confinement 23 hours a day and their contact with other inmates and outsiders was severely restricted. But even this did not stop the AB from carrying out its criminal activities. Several court cases have made clear that AB leaders are able to organize major criminal activities, including ordering people’s deaths, despite their isolation. In many cases, officials say, they do this through their wives or girlfriends, and in some they have been able to use their lawyers. In others, they are known to use highly sophisticated written codes and invisible inks. 

During the 1990s, the rapidly swelling AB increasingly favored organized criminal activity over promoting racism. That meant that the gang’s leaders recognized that drug trafficking in prison was a highly profitable enterprise and the gang began to sell drugs to African American and Latino inmates. According to imprisoned ex-AB “commissioner” John Greschner, who left the gang in 1999, race war ideology within the AB today is clearly secondary to its criminal activity. Greschner also has detailed how the gang instituted a sophisticated banking and collection system that included a 20% “tax” on the profits of any AB criminal enterprise on the streets. That money is laundered and controlled by the AB commissioners.

The AB’s criminal operations on the outside received a huge boost when Italian-American Mafia boss John Gotti was sentenced to life in prison without parole and transferred to the Marion facility in 1992. Gotti hired the AB to protect him, but went on to organize a business partnership between his associates and AB members on the outside. The move gave the AB unprecedented power on the streets, where the group had been operating in major cities since the 1980s, with an appointed leader in each city or, in the case of more sparsely populated areas, each region.

Gotti was not the gang’s first high-profile client. During the early 1970s, cult leader Charles Manson sought the AB’s protection. He was refused membership because he declined to kill other inmates because of their skin color. But the AB still used his coterie of female fans to smuggle drugs and weapons into San Quentin.

The AB is a notoriously deadly organization. Some years ago, authorities calculated that while the group’s members made up less than one tenth of 1% of the U.S. prison inmate population, they were responsible for 18% of all prison murders.

In recent years, authorities have been repeatedly frustrated by the way that imprisoned AB leaders have been able to organize and direct major criminal enterprises even from solitary confinement, where most are held. In 2002, they moved to indict 29 leaders of the federal AB organization, all of them held in various prisons around the country, for violations of federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations(RICO) Act. Twenty-one of the leaders were charged with death penalty offenses, even though many were already serving life terms, because prosecutors felt that was the only way they could stop their criminal activities. Among those charged with capital offenses were AB commissioners Mills and Bingham. But the tactic failed spectacularly when juries returned many convictions but no death penalties. The officials’ so-called “decapitation strike” had failed.

Members of the AB typically can be easily identified by their tattoos. Popular tattoos among AB members include a shamrock inscribed with the number 666, swastikas, the abbreviation A.B., and double lightning bolts, which stand for Hitler’s SS.

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:

Any and all documents and materials (such as files,reports,photographs,videos recordings,audio recordings ect..) be they electronic or otherwise regarding:

'Banca Nazionale del Lavoro' (BNL) whis has been a subsidiary of 'BNP Paribas' since 2006.

The bank was involved in a major political scandal (dubbed 'Iraq-gate' by the US media) when it was revealed in 1989 that the Atlanta, Georgia branch of the bank was making unauthorized loans of more than US $4.5 billion to Iraq. Many of the loans that the branch made were guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation program. The loans were originally intended to finance agricultural exports to Iraq, but were diverted by Iraq to buy weapons. The branch manager, Christopher P. Drogoul, indicated that the bank's headquarters office was aware of these loans, but senior bank official denied this. Drogoul pleaded guilty to three felony charges and served 33 months in federal prison.

The requested material will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the requested documents sent electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or sent via CD-ROM if not.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, the data management system (EDMS) and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant places,names,individuals,agencies and companies.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.","1368029, DOJ-AP-2019-002182",FALSE,1584,735,Public Domain Programming: the Source Code of the Government,,0.00,2017-02-13 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-14,2019-06-12 13:28:10.440787+00:00,bank-robbers-app-dev-33284

MuckRock is a 501(c)(3), not-for-profit, educational organization, and, by definition, it has no commercial purpose. MuckRock exists to educate the public about the operations and activities of government, as well as to increase public understanding about the importance of ethics and the rule of law in government.

The particular records requested herein are sought as part of MuckRock's ongoing efforts to document the operations and activities of of government agencies and to educate the public about these operations and activities. Once MuckRock obtains the requested records, it intends to analyze them and disseminate the results of its analysis.

There is a clear public interest case in having these files released therefore I request fees be waived for the following reasons:

1) The questions raised about the government's motivations, integrity and judgment on this issue.

2) Any wrongdoing by the subject(s) in question, the government and/or other federal officials the materials may expose.

3) The subject is of ""widespread and exceptional media interest"" the widespread public interest and reporting on this case.

4) As a journalist and member of muckrock.com, I am engaged in reporting and disseminating information to the public, free of charge.",1396545,FALSE,1222,790,,,0.00,2018-02-10 05:00:00+00:00,2018-03-13,2019-04-18 04:56:00+00:00,brotherhood-of-eternal-love-48578

It’s also the only KKK faction to establish chapters outside the U.S., with a sizable presence in Canada.

Where most present-day Klan groups splash pictures and news of their activities on their websites and online forums, the Brotherhood of Klans is exceptionally secretive, in the tradition of Klan groups of yesteryear, offering scant details of its actions online and conducting serious background checks of prospective members. In other ways, the BOK is quite modern. Its members often eschew white robes and hoods for paramilitary garb, and its leadership networks extensively with non-Klan white supremacists, most notably racist skinheads and outlaw bikers, as well as with other Klan outfits, especially those based in the Deep South.

The Brotherhood of Klans was founded in 1996 by Dale Fox, an old-school Southern Klansman who vowed to bring the Klan back to its original birthplace in Pulaski, Tenn. The closest Fox got to that goal was establishing a BOK chapter in Finger, Tenn., more than 100 miles west of Pulaski.

Even so, under Fox’s leadership, the Brotherhood of Klans rapidly became the biggest Ku Klux Klan organization in the United States. Fox’s power appeared to expand in 2002 when rival Klan leader Ron Edwards, who was then under intense law enforcement scrutiny, stepped down as imperial wizard, or national leader, of the Imperial Klans of America and appointed Fox to replace him. The following year, though, Edwards reclaimed his position atop the IKA. But when Fox left, he took a handful of IKA chapters with him.

Fox died of a heart attack in November 2006, while chopping down a tree on a fellow Klansman’s property. He was succeeded by Jeremy Parker, a former skinhead and former webmaster for the neo-Nazi Aryan Nations.

In 2007, Parker oversaw the Brotherhood of Klan’s expansion into Canada, establishing chapters in Regina, Saskatchewan, and Calgary, Alberta, which claim a combined membership of 250. Both Canadian chapters have participated in joint rallies and street demonstrations with the Aryan Guard, a violent neo-Nazi group based in Calgary.

My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.",1363699-000,FALSE,1636,1532,"Haters: Documenting Extremist and Hate Groups,Subjects Matter: FBI Files",,0.00,2016-12-23 05:00:00+00:00,2017-01-25,2017-04-06 00:00:00+00:00,brotherhood-of-klans-31221

Fee Waiver Request:
1. The records requested will contribute to the understanding of the government's operations and activities. This is since it will reveal important details of the FBI's goals. This would be since the calendars would show the indirect interests of the FBI. The calendar would lead to understanding of the director's issues and solutions. Also, it would highlight and explain a timeline of what was happening. Lastly, it would show layers of the ""life as a director"". This would allow people to understand how and why the director, and indirectly the FBI, acted. Lastly, it would allow a clearer picture to the scandals and prove or disprove them.
2. There are many ways how the public would want this. I would like to point that everyone has been intrigued in what Comey has done. Also, since 2016 there has been an uproar in wanting to know what the FBI has done and will do.
3. This will allow the public to have more understanding. This is since the public has had slight "" shades of light"". This information will show the scope of Wray and Comey. Ultimately, it will allow the public to be submerged in full light. This has been shown through CNN, FOX, etc. Finally, it will show some details that might otherwise not be known.

Expedited Processing:
The public would like to know what was going on in the FBI day by day. It will show many things that will prove or disprove, and might cause more wanting. Per your knowledge of the public's interest, I request expedited processing. Also, Muckrock is a website that will deliver this information.

Founded in 1988 by former Reagan administration official Frank Gaffney, Jr., The Center for Security Policy (CSP) has gone from a respected hawkish think tank focused on foreign affairs to a conspiracy-oriented mouthpiece for the growing anti-Muslim movement in the United States.

Known for its accusations that a shadowy “Muslim Brotherhood” has infiltrated all levels of government and warnings that “creeping Shariah,” or Islamic religious law, is a threat to American democracy, CSP’s Gaffney has called for Congressional hearings along the lines of the notorious Cold War-era House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) to expose Muslim conspiracies. CSP has even been banned from the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a premier gathering of thousands of conservatives each spring in Washington, D.C.

Frank Gaffney, Jr. founded the neo-conservative turned anti-Muslim think tank Center for Security Policy (CSP) in 1988, following his tenure as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Nuclear Forces and Arms Control Policy in the Ronald Reagan administration.

From the late 80’s to the mid-2000’s, CSP was seen as a mainstream though hawkish organization that favored the so-called “peace through strength” doctrine popularized by President Reagan. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the CSP never left its Cold War mentality, and instead shifted its focus from battling Communism to fighting Islam.

Along those lines, CSP supported the so called “War on Terror” and in 2002, a prominent British newspaper listed Frank Gaffney with Iraq invasion cheerleaders Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, and Richard Perle as one of the men “directing” then-President George W. Bush’s post 9/11 security doctrine.

For the past decade, CSP’s main focus has been on demonizing Islam and Muslims under the guise of national security. Statements from Frank Gaffney and other CSP staffers, along with claims made in CSP publications, have become increasingly conspiratorial in nature, making such claims as Muslims are attempting to overthrow the US government from within, and that Shariah law is trumping the constitution in American courts.

In the late 2000’s the anti-Muslim movement in America became more organized, and CSP quickly established itself as one of the movement’s premier think tanks. Many of the other organizations making up this movement, such as the grassroots group ACT! for America, were young, but CSP enjoyed extensive contacts in Washington after almost 20 years working in the capital. Gaffney and CSP thus became a key player in the anti-Muslim movement almost overnight.

In 2010, CSP teamed up with some of America’s most notorious anti-Muslim activists, who Gaffney referred to as “Team B II,” to produce a report titled “Shariah: The Treat To America.” The name “Team B II” is a nod to the original “Team B,” a group of conservative analysts commissioned by the CIA in 1976 to evaluate classified information on the threat the Soviet Union posed. That evaluation has been declassified, and determined to be mostly inaccurate, having grossly exaggerated the threat the Soviet Union then posed to the United States. A Senate investigative committee found in 1978 that the members of the original Team B had “yielded a flawed composition of political views and biases.”

Nevertheless, the CSP-produced report focused on what it called the “preeminent totalitarian threat of our time: the legal-political-military doctrine known within Islam as shariah [sic].” The report is a 170-page compendium of conspiracy theories and anti-Islamic claims, including the notion that “many of the most prominent Muslim organizations in America are front groups for the Muslim Brotherhood,” which, the report claims, is trying to implement Shariah law across the U.S. and around the world.

The report concluded with a number of alarmist recommendations, including a call for U.S. government agencies to halt outreach to Muslim communities “through Muslim Brotherhood fronts whose mission it is to destroy our country from within, as such practices are both reckless and counterproductive.” Other recommendations included warning Imams that they will be charged with sedition if they advocate for Shariah in America. The report also called for dismantling so-called “no-go zones”—non-existent neighborhoods where law enforcement are rumored to be unable to police because they’re heavily Muslim. The report’s authors admit that, “such measures will, of course, be controversial in some quarters.”

CSP recruited several people to contribute to the report, including Tom Trento, founder of the anti-Islam group The United West (Florida Security Council), who has a record of peddling anti-Islam conspiracy theories. Trento once addressed a crowd in Florida in December 2015 after the Broward County Sheriff hired a Muslim deputy, saying, “What the hell is going on that Scott Israel [the sheriff] hires a terrorist!” Diana West was another contributor. An author and columnist, West has said that it is really the basic teachings of Islam, not “some peculiar strain called ‘Islamism’ or of an organization such as the Muslim Brotherhood or ISIS,” that poses a threat to Americans’ constitutional liberties.  

Also a member of “Team B II” was Lt. General Jerry Boykin, a retired three-star general. In 2010, the same year the Team B II report was released, Boykin appeared on a video of the Christian Dominionist-leaning Oak Initiative stating, “[Islam] should not be protected under the First Amendment, particularly given that those following the dictates of the Quran are under an obligation to destroy our Constitution and replace it with sharia law.” He has also referred to Islam as “evil.” Boykin is currently the executive vice president of the Family Research Council (FRC), an anti-LGBT hate group.

Another Team B II contributor was John Guandolo, a disgraced former FBI agent. Guandolo joined the FBI’s counterterrorism division in the wake of 9/11, but by 2005 he was posing as a driver for a “star witness” in the corruption case of former Congressman William Jefferson (D-LA). He made “inappropriate sexual advances” to that witness and soon was having an “intimate relationship…that he thought could damage an investigation.” He also unsuccessfully solicited the witness for a $75,000 donation to an organization he supported and carried on extramarital affairs with female FBI agents.

Guandolo’s actions risked ruining the government’s prosecution of Jefferson, and he faced an investigation by the bureau's Office of Professional Responsibility. Though he later expressed “deep remorse” for his actions, he resigned from the bureau in December, 2008, ahead of an internal review. Not long after, he became a full-time anti-Muslim activist and conspiracy theorist—all under the guise of being a counterterrorism expert. According to his resume, Guandolo became Vice President of the Strategic Engagement Group the same month he resigned from the FBI. He describes the tiny consultancy as the “only company in the United States aimed at identifying potential threats to homeland security.” He currently travels the country training law enforcement on counter-terror techniques and speaks at various events. In 2013 he made an appearance at an event hosted by the anti-immigrant Social Contract Press, a group that regularly publishes white nationalist authors.

Two other members of CSP’s Team B II report are current CSP staffers, namely Clare Lopez, a former CSP fellow and current vice president for research and analysis, and David Yerushalmi, Esq., CSP’s general counsel. Lopez spent two decades at the CIA before joining up with Gaffney. Her history of touting anti-Muslim conspiracy theories echoes those of CSP. She has long claimed, for example, that the Muslim Brotherhood has “infiltrated and suborned the U.S. government to actively assist … the mission of its grand jihad.” She wrote a 2013 report that linked Huma Abedin, deputy chief of staff to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, to the Muslim Brotherhood — a favorite, but false, allegation on the far right that earned condemnation from conservative members of Congress like Senator John McCain (R-AZ).

Yerushalmi is the architect of the “anti-Shariah” bills that appeared in dozens of states in recent years. Yerushalmi began his campaign in 2006 by founding the Society of Americans for National Existence (SANE), an anti-Muslim organization devoted to promoting his theory that Islam is inherently seditious and that Shariah, is a “criminal conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government.” He equates Shariah with Islamic extremism so totally that he advocates criminalizing virtually any personal practice compliant with Shariah. In his view, only a Muslim who fully breaks with the customs of Shariah can be considered socially tolerable.

In early 2012, Yerulshalmi founded the American Freedom Law Center (AFLC) along with fellow attorney Robert Muise of the Thomas More Law Center, a Christian Right law firm. Arguing that America has “unique values of liberty and freedom” that do not exist in foreign legal system,  the AFLC has launched an “American Laws for American Courts” initiative to push model anti-Shariah legislation, drafted primarily by Yerushalmi, in state houses across the country,. Legal experts accurately describe such anti-Shariah measures as superfluous given that there is no mechanism by which any foreign criminal or civil code can trump U.S. laws. By the summer of 2013, however, anti-foreign law measures had passed in Arizona, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Tennessee and North Carolina. Similar bills are being introduced in states in 2016.

A year after CSP published the Team B II report, Gaffney’s anti-Muslim conspiracy theories began to draw the ire of not only the left, but also the right. In January 2011, Gaffney penned a piece for the conspiracy-orientated website World Net Daily where he claimed that two board members of the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC) were secretly aiding the Muslim Brotherhood. Gaffney’s evidence for such an accusation was that board member and anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist’s wife is Palestinian-American, while board member Suhail Khan is Muslim. Both were political appointees in the George W. Bush administration with long experience in conservative Republican Party affairs.

CPAC chairman David Keene responded to these claims by banning Gaffney and CSP from participating at the event, noting that Gaffney ""has become personally and tiresomely obsessed with his weird belief that anyone who doesn't agree with him on everything all the time or treat him with the respect and deference he believes is his due, must be either ignorant of the dangers we face or, in extreme case, dupes of the nation's enemies.""

The CSP serves to propagate Gaffney’s claims, often by issuing alarming “investigative” reports and other products, like the 10-part video course hosted by Gaffney titled “The Muslim Brotherhood in America,” and to further a conspiratorial outlook of Muslim Americans: “America faces in addition to the threat of violent jihad another, even more toxic danger — a stealthy and pre-violent form of warfare aimed at destroying our constitutional form of democratic government and free society. The Muslim Brotherhood is the prime-mover behind this seditious campaign, which it calls ‘civilization jihad’.” 

In keeping with its Cold War traditions, CSP issued another dubious report, titled, “Rise of the ‘Iran Lobby’: Tehran’s front groups move on– and into– the Obama Administration” in 2009. The report alleged that an “Iran Lobby” is operating in Washington, D.C., and influencing U.S. policy through a network of shady operatives and prominent politicos. The report said that “in one way or another” then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass, and Dennis Ross, then the special advisor for the Persian Gulf and Southwest Asia to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were among those with ties to the Iran Lobby.

As the anti-Muslim movement began to increase in size and influence, CSP also branched out to potential allies in the anti-immigrant movement. Gaffney for example, is an admirer and ally of Mark Krikorian, head of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) which essentially plays the same role in anti-immigrant circles as does CSP in the anti-Muslim movement – namely, providing reports with dubious claims and conspiracy theories that grassroots groups and others can use as “proof” to support anti-immigrant claims.

In the winter of 2012 CIS hosted Gaffney at the Women’s National Republican Club in Manhattan to discuss the topic ""Immigration as a Catalyst for Shariah in the West?"" Gaffney’s opening remarks were telling, in that he admitted that he wanted to help further bridge the gap between the already-converging anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant movements in the United States.

“In truth,” Gaffney said, “I’m sure you’re here for the Center for Immigration Studies, at least I hope you are, because I’m here for the Center for Immigration Studies because I have had a chance to work with Mark and his team a lot.” He went on to say that, “one of the things I hope we might talk about in the course of the conversation is what we might do much more of because I see a nexus developing between the work that Mark really does uniquely in this country and the work that we do, and it would be terrific if we could collaborate more intensively.”

In truth, CSP has organized with anti-immigrant groups for over a decade. In 2005, for example, Gaffney spoke at an event co-sponsored by the anti-immigrant hate group Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). FAIR and CIS account for two of the “big three” anti-immigrant groups in the U.S., and CSP is also allied with the third, NumbersUSA , the anti-immigrant movement’s grassroots mobilizer. Rosemary Jenks, NumbersUSA’s vice president and director of government relations, is a stalwart at CSP events.

In 2013, the inflammatory right-wing site Breitbart News hosted “Uninvited,” a series of panels in the same hotel as CPAC 2013. Those panels featured a number of anti-Muslim commentators and activists, including Pamela Geller, Robert Spencer and Gaffney. Kicking off that event was Rep. Steve King (R-IA), a supporter of the anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim movements who has suggested that the U.S. government should spy on mosques and attempted to paint two Muslim congressmen as un-American by not “renouncing Shariah law.” King also said in early 2015 that undocumented immigrants given a path to citizenship will “destroy our republic.”

Breitbart organized a larger conference in 2014 titled “The Uninvited II: National Security Action Summit,” which was moderated by Gaffney. It took place at a hotel down the street from the 2014 CPAC conference in Washington, D.C. The summit featured anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant speakers as well as politicians, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), speaking on panels with titles like, “Amnesty and Open Borders: The End of America – and the GOP,” and “Benghazigate: The Ugly Truth and the Cover-up,” part of the right-wing’s continued attempt to use the tragic events in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 to hurt the Obama administration and Secretary of Clinton. An investigation into the attacks on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi led by the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee found no wrongdoing by Obama administration officials.

CSP held its annual awards ceremony in 2015 at the posh Metropolitan Club of New York City. The packed fundraiser honored Congressman Trent Franks (R-AZ), a champion for the anti-Muslim cause, as well as Beth Van Duyne, the mayor of Irving, Texas. The mayor made national headlines in February 2015 when she began vocally opposing a tribunal dealing with civil cases between Muslim couples, in which an Imam was acting as the arbitrator. Van Duyne and CSP saw this as proof of their claims that Shariah law was being implemented in the US, even though similar religious tribunals have existed for decades in the American Jewish and American Christian communities to resolve disputes, something the Islamic Center of Irving duly noted in its response to the mayor.

In September, a few months after Van Duyne received CSP’s 2015 “Defender of Freedom” award, police in Irving arrested a 14-year-old Muslim student on suspicion that he had brought a bomb to his school. The “bomb” turned out to be a homemade clock. Not long after Ahmed Mohamed’s wrongful arrest, CSP’s Clare Lopez told the crowd on a panel at the Christian Right Values Voter Summit in Washington D.C. that she had just gotten back from Irving where she and John Guandolo had been training law enforcement.

The bulk of CSP’s efforts in 2015 were devoted to creating a climate a fear around Syrian refugees entering the United States. Thousands of Syrian refugees fled their war-torn homeland in 2015 for European countries and the U.S., which has created an anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim backlash in this country and Europe. CSP put out a survey asking to “collect contact and geographical data from those who wish to stay engaged” in “refugee resettlement action” – meaning working to prevent the relocation of refuges to a certain locations.

CSP has also taken Ann Corcoran, the face of the anti-refugee movement in America, under its wing. Corcoran also promotes “refugee resettlement action” which she calls “pockets of resistance” to refugee resettlement. In April 2015, Corcoran released “Refugee Resettlement and the Hijra to America,"" a pamphlet published by the CSP which included calls for Americans to oppose the opening of mosques in their neighborhoods and a ban on all Muslim immigration to the United States. Corcoran also spoke at two of CSP’s major events in 2015. CSP continues to work on creating model legislation at the county level that would ban all Syrian refugee relocation to counties that enacted it.

CSP’s campaign against Syrian refugees prompted its founder to seek out more radical allies. In September 2015, Gaffney invited white nationalist Jared Taylor on his radio show to discuss the Syrian refugee crisis. Taylor is considered a preeminent spokesman for the white nationalist movement in America.

During the interview, Gaffney called Taylor's white nationalist American Renaissance website ""wonderful,"" and asked, “Is it the death of Europe what we’re seeing at the moment in terms of this migration, this invasion?” After a number of watchdog groups including the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote about Taylor’s appearance on the radio show, Gaffney backtracked, and attempted to bury the evidence by scrubbing the Taylor interview from his site and claiming he was “unfamiliar” with Taylor’s views before inviting him on.

With an eye on the 2016 election, CSP organized and held four National Security Action Summits in 2015 in early election states including Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. A number of the GOP candidates joined the cast of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant characters at these Summits, including Ben Carson, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. 

Gaffney again teamed up with Cruz and Trump following the announcement of the Iran nuclear deal. Trump and Cruz held an anti-Iran rally in Washington, D.C. on September 9, 2015, which was co-sponsored by CSP. Brigitte Gabriel, head of the largest grassroots anti-Muslim group in the country, ACT! for America, also spoke. 

On December 7, 2015, GOP candidate Donald Trump issued a press release calling to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Trump’s campaign cited a bogus CSP poll released a few months earlier in June claiming ""25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad"" and that 51 percent of those polled ""agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah."" Trump praised the staff of CSP, stating they are ""very highly respected people, who I know, actually.”

When the poll was first released , the Bridge Initiative at Georgetown University, a project started to connect the academic study of Islamophobia with the public square, debunked it immediately, noting that, “CSP’s survey was a non-probability based, opt-in online survey, administered by the conservative group, the Polling Company/Woman Trend, a small Washington-based agency that has collaborated with CSP on other occasions to produce surveys about Islam and Muslims.” In parentheses, the Bridge Initiative stated, “We learned this after reaching out to the Polling Company to get more details about their methodology, which wasn’t released to the public when Gaffney began promoting the survey’s findings.” According to the body that sets ethical standards for polling, the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), opt-in surveys cannot be considered representative of the intended population, in this case Muslims.”

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

Hansen was best known for compiling and publishing information regarding nuclear weapons. Published accounts suggest Hansen was interviewed by the FBI around 1993 in connection with a FOIA request he filed, see https://fas.org/sgp/bulletin/sec32.html .

In addition to all other searches you would customarily conduct, please conduct cross-referenced, ELSUR, relevant field office (including but not limited to San Francisco Field office, and any relevant subcomponents such as the Palo Alto or San Jose resident agencies if relevant records may be stored at those locations), and ARC (and any other such facility/system of old records) searches using electronic and manual indices as appropriate.

This request is not being made for commercial purposes. The requested records will be immediately and freely available to the public on muckrock.com.

I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by portal upload or e-mail attachment if available, or CD-ROM if not. 


Thanks for your help!

EmmaBest,Church of the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,Completed,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/church-of-the-national-knights-of-the-ku-klux-klan-31223/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning the Church of the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Once one of the largest and most active Klan groups in America, the Church of the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan has more recently gained a kind of ""Keystone Kops"" reputation on the white supremacist scene for its bumbling ways.

The National Knights of the Klu Klux Klan formed in 1960 as a response to the growing civil rights movement. Originally a collection of splintered Klan groups from several southern states, this loose confederation quickly grew into one of the largest Klan groups in the nation. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the National Knights coordinated a series of cross burnings across the South (reportedly more than 1,000) on March 26, 1960, and claimed between 10,000 and 15,000 members.

From 1963 until his death in 1993, James R. Venable served as the imperial wizard, or national leader, of the National Knights. A Georgia lawyer whose ancestors owned the legendary Stone Mountain near Atlanta — the site of the 1915 rally that inaugurated the so-called ""second era"" Klan — Venable used the mountaintop and nearby family land for annual rallies that drew members from the National Knights but also other Klan factions. In 1993, the year he died, Venable appointed Railton Loy, a former railroad worker who goes by the Klan name Ray Larsen, to take over as the next imperial wizard. Under Loy's leadership, the National Knights continued to hold rallies at the group's new headquarters outside of South Bend, Ind. But unlike in the past, attendance at these events was sparse. Just 35 supporters showed up for a May 5, 2001, rally, for instance, while over 200 people attended a nearby counter-protest, according to the South Bend Tribune. 

Even worse than the low turnouts, these events often proved embarrassing for National Knights, leading to tangles with the law. After the 2001 rally was over, as police escorted the Klan members to their cars and away from the counter-protesters, Klansmen could not remember where they parked. In the confusion, a fight with counter-protesters began that resulted in eight arrests, including that of Loy's son, Grand Dragon (or state leader) Richard Loy. It didn't stop there. Local newspaper coverage of the rally used the elder Loy's real name instead of his preferred alias, Ray Larsen. After Loy allegedly called a reporter, demanding that she use his alias and asking where she lived, he was charged with misdemeanor telephone harassment. Then, the next month, two sheriff's deputies in Williamson County, Texas, were fired after they tried to recruit a fellow officer with an application touting ""White Supremacy."" Dept. David Gay, 44, and Sgt. Greg Palm, 29, had both worked for the sheriff's office for more than four years. 

The National Knights really lived up to their ""Keystone Kops"" reputation when Railton and Richard Loy hosted what was widely billed as a ""Christmas unity rally"" on Dec. 8, 2002, at the younger Loy's Osceola, Ind., farm. They hoped to bring together various factions of the contentious world of professional racists, and indeed, they drew members of two far larger groups — the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the Aryan Nations, which sent its then-propaganda chief, August Kreis. Close to 50 people gathered for the Saturday afternoon dinner and cross burning. As hungry racists filed into the shed where food was being served, it quickly became apparent that the Loys had forgotten a critical fact: Large numbers of Klansmen are followers of Christian Identity, a racist and anti-Semitic theology that holds that Jews are biologically Satanic and whites are the true Israelites — meaning, according to Identity adherents' reading of the Bible, that whites can't eat pork. When guest Klansmen strolled into the shed and were confronted by a dead pig that by all accounts was barely cooked, several Klansmen and Aryan Nations members recoiled with horror. 

The situation became even more ridiculous. As the gathered haters circulated and clucked about the culinary faux pas — and while a red-suited ""Klanta Klaus"" worked the crowd nearby — some got to wondering why Rick Loy had a badly swollen lip and two missing front teeth. Soon enough, the story came out, provoking a fresh round of mirth. After being presented with a riot shield that was alleged to be bulletproof, Loy had apparently decided to put the matter to a test, firing a round into the shield at close range. Unsurprisingly, the bullet ricocheted off the shield — which stood up to the tryout admirably — and hit Loy in the mouth. 

Things got worse still. As the climactic moment of the afternoon arrived, Klansmen struggled to set up a giant swastika to burn. It collapsed on the ground. Finally, the Nazi symbol was burned where it lay. Then it was time for the cross. It quickly became apparent that it wasn't going to be possible to get the cross upright for burning — at least not the way it had been constructed. In the end, someone had the bright idea of sawing about 12 feet off the wooden cross' bottom, after which it, too, was finally lit. Not long afterward, the rally then came to an end, and its embarrassed participants headed for home. 

Despite its sometimes comical stumbles, the National Knights remains a potentially violent and dangerous group. This fact became obvious on Jan. 1, 2003, when Glen Gautier, a member of the National Knights, confessed to authorities his role in the brutal murder of another Klan member. By his own account, Gautier, who was 50 at the time, had carried out the killing with three other members of two separate but allied Klan chapters, or ""klaverns,"" that roamed the backwoods of semi-rural central North Carolina in 2001, stealing guns, making bombs, plotting murders, and carrying out at least one. His confession triggered parallel state murder and federal gunrunning cases, which have since dragged on for years. In the end, two members of the National Knights pleaded guilty in 2006 to charges in connection with a plot to blow up the Johnston County, N.C., courthouse and kill Sheriff Steve Bizzell, and were sentenced to a year in federal prison after cooperating with authorities. Two months later, in December, a judge found Klan boss and alleged ringleader Charles Barefoot incompetent to stand trial for orchestrating the murder of a fellow Klansman suspected of informing to police.

In his May 9 termination letter to Director Comey, President Trump stated, “While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.” https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3711113/Comey-White-House-DOJ-DAG.pdf

In a May 11 interview with NBC News's Lester Holt, President Trump expanded on this claim, asserting that the three occasions involved one dinner at the White House and two phone calls. http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/11/politics/transcript-donald-trump-nbc-news/ 

If the president’s account is true, then he has confirmed this information in a public venue and any related documents should not be treated as confidential.

The New York Times detailed the only time they could confirm that Director Comey and President Trump shared a meal was on January 27, 2017. It is unclear when, precisely, the phone calls may have happened. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/politics/trump-comey-firing.html 

Fee Waiver Request

I respectfully request that you waive all fees in connection with this request as provided by 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 40 C.F.R. § 2.107(l). The Sierra Club is a national environmental nonprofit with no commercial interest in obtaining the requested information. Instead, our organization intends to analyze and disseminate the requested information free of charge so that the public can be better informed and meaningfully participate in government oversight.

As explained below, this FOIA request satisfies the factors listed in the Justice Department's governing regulations for waiver or reduction of fees – as well as the requirements of fee waiver under the FOIA statute – that “disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), see also 40 C.F.R. § 2.107(l).

The subject matter of the requested records is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government by settling the disputed issue that Director Comey disclosed to President Trump that the FBI was not investigating the president. 

Detailing the status of a criminal investigation to an associated individual is against agency protocol. In the New York Times article mentioned above and a follow-up NBC News story, multiple anonymous sources close to former Director Comey disputed the president’s claims. http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/my-dinner-comey-current-former-fbi-officials-dispute-trump-account-n758221 

The individuals, including current and former FBI officials, told the news outlets that Director Comey never would have told the president he was not under investigation, that Director Comey did not ask to keep his job during the conversation, and that Director Comey did not request the dinner. White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in turn, denied the sources’ claims that the president asked Director Comey for a pledge of loyalty.

Several of these disputes are clearly in the public interest, as evidenced by the large amount of news coverage as well as the strong concerns expressed by members of Congress and legal and ethics experts. Additionally, information related to these conversations would help shed a light on why the director of the FBI was abruptly fired without a clear successor having been identified. Clarification on these matters is needed to protect the integrity of an independent FBI.

The Sierra Club and its supporters have demonstrated interest and expertise in the subject area, specifically the development of policies designed to safeguard our democracy, enforce the rule of law, and ensure government transparency. The Sierra Club maintains an active Democracy program and weighs in when nominations and legislation affect that work. In recent months, tens of thousands of our supporters have sent letters to government officials regarding the “Trump-Russia” investigation. 

Media Requester Status

The Sierra Club has the ability and intention to disseminate the information it receives through this request. The information may be shared through emails to an audience reaching into the millions, Facebook and Twitter posts reaching tens of thousands of followers, articles on our often-visited website, and analysis provided to the media.

My professional duties at the Sierra Club include composing mass communications to our followers, analyzing FOIA responses, and coordinating with press secretaries. Here are three such examples that resulted from my work:

https://sierraclub.org/planet/2017/04/hiring-freeze-prevented-epa-filling-hundreds-jobs 
http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/13/politics/epa-hiring-freeze/index.html 
http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/press-releases/4480/over-700000-people-tell-government-to-block-seed-mergers 

The bulk of my work entails planning and writing content about public policy and distributing it through email, webpages, and social media. 

I ask that, in addition to being granted a public interest fee waiver, I be properly categorized as a representative of the news media, as the information I have presented shows that I meet the definition expressed in 28 CFR § 16.10(b)(6): “any person or entity that actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. 

Expedited Treatment

Due to the exceptional circumstances surrounding the Trump-Russia investigations and the FBI director's ouster, I request expedited treatment of this FOIA request, which meets two of the Department of Justice’s possible rationales for granting expedited processing.
 
28 C.F.R. § 16.5(e)(1)(iv) provides for expedited processing when there is a ""matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence."" 

President Trump himself alluded to the lack of public confidence in the government’s investigations in his May 9 termination letter: “It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.” This is juxtaposed against a number of news articles and prominent individuals that question the president’s rationale for firing Director Comey, dispute his recollection of the content of their conversations, and express concerns over the integrity of the FBI’s future investigations.

In addition to the articles mentioned in the Background Information and Fee Waiver Request sections, one may find a large amount of news covering the disputed content of the Trump-Comey conversations. Here are a few additional examples:

http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-comey-holt-20170511-story.html
http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/president-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey-article-1.3150918 
http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/05/donald-trump-firing-james-comey-investigation-fbi-russia 
http://www.npr.org/2017/05/11/527950704/trump-says-he-called-comey-and-asked-if-he-was-under-investigation

28 C.F.R. § 16.5 (e)(1)(ii) provides the other relevant rationale for an expedited processing determination: ""An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information."" 

As described in the Media Requester Status section, my primary professional activity is information dissemination. This request meets the three primary factors in determining whether there is an urgency to inform:

1. The request concerns a matter of current exigency to the American public, given the central roles the involved officials play in the Trump-Russia investigation and the possibility that top administration officials are using their positions to influence it. Furthermore, the president is likely to nominate a replacement FBI director in the coming days ahead; U.S. senators and citizens should have these documents available at that time to provide context during the confirmation process.
2. The consequences of delaying a response would compromise a significant recognized interest. Delaying this information through the normal FOIA process would represent a clear loss in value to the developing breaking news story and could impact the ability of the FBI to reliably conduct its investigation in an independent manner. 
3. The request concerns federal government activity: conversations that occurred between the White House and the FBI pertaining to work that FBI agents are conducting.

The information contained in this request is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Exempt Records

Should you decide to invoke a FOIA exemption with regard to any of the requested records, please include in your response letter sufficient information for an appeal, including:

1. Basic factual material about each withheld item, including the originator, date, length, general subject matter, and location of each item.
2. Explanations and justifications for denial, including the identification of the category within the governing statutory provision under which the document (or portion thereof) was withheld and a full explanation of how each exemption fits the withheld material.

If you determine that portions of a requested record are exempt from disclosure, please redact the exempt portions and provide the remainder of the record.

Record Delivery

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. In the event that there are fees, please inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. 

Please produce the records on a rolling basis; at no point should the search for – or deliberation concerning – certain records delay the production of others that the agency has already retrieved and elected to produce.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your timely response.

Sincerely,

Alexander Rony

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy.""

The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.""

The Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC) is the modern reincarnation of the old White Citizens Councils, which were formed in the 1950s and 1960s to battle school desegregation in the South. Created in 1985 from the mailing lists of its predecessor organization, the CCC has evolved into a crudely white supremacist group.

Among other things, its Statement of Principles says that it “oppose[s] all efforts to mix the races of mankind.” Created in 1985 from the mailing lists of its predecessor organization, the CCC, which initially tried to project a ""mainstream"" image, has evolved into a crudely white supremacist group whose website has run pictures comparing the late pop singer Michael Jackson to an ape and referred to black people as ""a retrograde species of humanity."" The group's newspaper, Citizens Informer, regularly publishes articles condemning ""race mixing,"" decrying the evils of illegal immigration, and lamenting the decline of white, European civilization. Gordon Baum, the group’s founder, died in March of 2015.

Founded in 1985 by Gordon Baum, a worker's compensation attorney and longtime racist activist, the Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC) rose from the ashes of the Citizens Councils of America (CCA), commonly called ""White Citizens Councils,"" a coalition of white-supremacist groups and individuals formed throughout the South to defend school segregation after the Supreme Court outlawed the policy in 1954 in Brown vs. Board of Education. 

Unlike the KKK, the CCA groups had a veneer of civic respectability, inspiring future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall to refer to it as the ""uptown Klan."" While there were plenty of bare-knuckle racists attracted to the councils' anti-integration slogan, ""Never!,"" the members also included bankers, merchants, judges, newspaper editors and politicians — folks given more to wearing suits and ties than hoods and robes. During the White Citizens Councils' heyday, the groups claimed more than 1 million members. Although they weren't immune to violence — Byron De La Beckwith, who murdered civil-rights leader Medgar Evers in 1963, was a member — the councils generally used their political and financial pull to offset the effects of ""forced integration."" 

Once the segregation battle was lost, the air went out of the White Citizens Councils. The councils steadily lost members throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Sensing the need for a new direction, Baum, formerly the CCA's Midwest field director, called together a group of 30 white men, including former Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox and future Louisiana Congressman John Rarick, for a meeting in Atlanta in 1985. Together, they cooked up a successor organization: the Council of Conservative Citizens. 

Like the original White Citizens Councils, the CCC is made up of local chapters, some of which are active in civic affairs beyond the national group's racist agenda. And until the 2000s, some of the group's ""uptown"" attitude remained, as meetings resembled Rotary Club events more than Klan outings and regularly featured politicians as keynote speakers. 

Most Americans learned of the CCC in late 1998, when a scandal erupted over prominent Southern politicians' ties to the brazenly racist group. After it was revealed that former Congressman Bob Barr (R-Ga.) gave the keynote speech at the CCC's 1998 national convention and that then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) had spoken to the group five times, both claimed they knew nothing about the CCC. However, an Intelligence Report investigation, publicized by national television and newspaper reports, made clear what the CCC really was: a hate group that routinely denigrated blacks as ""genetically inferior,"" complained about ""Jewish power brokers,"" called LGBT people ""perverted sodomites,"" accused immigrants of turning America into a ""slimy brown mass of glop,"" and named Lester Maddox, the now-deceased, ax handle-wielding, arch-segregationist former governor of Georgia, ""Patriot of the Century."" 

As evidence of widespread association between Southern GOP officeholders and the CCC mounted, Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson took the unusual step in 1998 of asking party members to resign from the group because of its racist views. A resolution moved through the U.S. Congress ""condemning the racism and bigotry espoused by the Council of Conservative Citizens,"" although it ultimately failed. (Congress had earlier condemned the black supremacist Nation of Islam in a similar manner, but failed to do the same with the CCC. Republican Party leaders, likely embarrassed by Lott's very public connection to the CCC, managed to defeat the censure effort.)

But six years later, many Southern lawmakers were still pandering to and meeting with the CCC — and still pleading ignorance. According to a 2004 Intelligence Report review of the Citizens Informer, no fewer than 38 federal, state and local elected officials had attended CCC events between 2000 and 2004, most of them giving speeches to local chapters of the hate group. 

Since the 1998/1999 scandal stripped much of the remaining varnish off the CCC's mainstream pretensions, the extremist views expressed on its website and in its newspaper have become increasingly crude. ""What do you call ... four blacks, three Hispanics, three Russian Jews, and one white guy?"" the CCC home page asked in 2003. ""The FBI's Most Wanted List!"" Another day, the home page ran photos of accused Beltway snipers John Muhammad and John Malvo, 9/11 conspirator Zacharias Moussaoui and shoe-bomber Richard Reed. ""Notice a Pattern Here?"" asked a caption underneath the four photos. ""Is the face of death black after all?"" In 2002, the Web site featured a photo of Daniel Pearl, the ""Jewish Wall Street Journal reporter"" who had just been decapitated by Islamic terrorists. In the photo, Pearl was shown with his ""mixed-race wife, Marianne."" The headline above the couple's picture was stunning even for the CCC: ""Death by Multiculturalism?""

The danger of ""race-mixing"" has been a consistent theme for the group since the days of the White Citizens Councils. ""God is the author of racism,"" said one story on the CCC's website in 2001. ""God is the One who divided mankind into different types. ... Mixing the races is rebelliousness against God."" After the NAACP declared its boycott of South Carolina in 1999 because the state continued to fly the Confederate battle flag over its Capitol dome, the CCC distributed a mock advertisement proclaiming, ""South Carolina Now Has Whiter Beaches!"" The Citizens Informer item urged whites to vacation in South Carolina and ""enjoy a civil liberty that has been denied to them for many years at hotels, restaurants and beaches: the freedom to associate with just one's own people.""

Along with theological arguments, the Citizens Informer has published countless stories detailing ""scientific"" evidence for white people's inherent superiority. Writing about Brown vs. Board of Education in 2004, contributor Michael Polignano noted that many commentators were using the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling striking down public school segregation to talk about ""how far America still falls short of racial equality."" According to Polignano, that lack of progress ""should surprise no one, because racial inequality is genetic and cannot be changed by social programs. ... Blacks are on average probably less intelligent than Whites and more aggressive, impulsive and prone to psychopathologies."" To prove this point, a 2005 article in the Citizens Informer written in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina described ""[a]ccounts of little children — girls and boys —being gang raped, rescue vans and copters being repeatedly fired upon by mobs of violent blacks, anarchy, chaos, confusion, looting even by black police officers."" 

More recently, the CCC has focused very heavily on battling non-white immigration. The group jumped quite early on the ""threat"" it perceived was posed by immigration, holding a rally against immigration in Cullman, Ala., in 1998 that featured major nativist hate group leaders Barbara Coe and Glenn Spencer, both of whom worked to pass the punishing California anti-immigrant Proposition 187 (the rally was also attended by an unrobed Klan leader and a top official of the Federation for American Immigration Reform). The CCC has held rallies nearly every year since then against immigration and the topic is addressed regularly at the CCC's biannual conferences, which have included as participants CCC leaders and prominent racists including Jared Taylor, editor of the anti-black and anti-Latino race science newsletter American Renaissance, and Don Black, founder of the first hate site on the web, Stormfront.org. 

CCC meetings have rarely featured politicians as speakers since the 2004 Intelligence Report exposé that exposed the fact that dozens of GOP politicians (and one Democrat) had been speaking at the group's events despite GOP chief Jim Nicholson's warnings in 1998. But a few have continued to associate with the CCC. In 2005, George Wallace Jr., the son of the late segregationist Alabama governor who was then an Alabama Public Service commissioner, spoke at the group's summer conference. In June 2008, another Alabama politician, state Sen. Charles Bishop (R-Jasper), addressed the group. Bishop's speech appealed to the assembled CCC crowd, particularly when he denounced the idea that Southern states should apologize for having sanctioned slavery. Bishop said that ""atonement equals reparations"" — meaning that apologies would surely be greeted by demands for financial payback by black Americans. Bishop received a standing ovation from the audience and he and his wife posed for pictures with members afterwards. 

And in 2009 Republican Mississippi State Sen. Lydia Chassaniol spoke to the group. She gave a rabble-rousing speech on ""Cultural Heritage in Mississippi."" In a brief history of the state since 1540, Chassaniol complained that the U.S. was in decline, as evidenced by tributes to Michael Jackson, a ""pedophile who's being celebrated."" She indicated that the government wants to ""take from those who have and give to those who don't want to work for it."" And she worried that the 2010 national census might hand over government ""to the radical left."" Chassaniol confirmed to the Southern Poverty Law Center that she is a member of the CCC, which she described as a ""conservative organization.""

A June 2011 barbeque held in Tennessee showcased another set of unsavory relationships maintained by the CCC. According to postings on website of the CCC’s Tennessee chapter, members of Volksfront and Blood and Honour, two notorious and violent racist skinhead groups, joined CCC members to network and discuss “ideas and plans to make a positive impact on our regions.” The then-head of the CCC, Gordon Baum, referred to the meeting as a “no-no” after stating that the chapter was not supposed to meet with “costumed Nazis.”

On April 7, 2013, Leonard R. Wilson of Jasper, Alabama, died. He was a charter member of the CCC, as well as the organization’s national secretary and the Alabama state coordinator. He earned the nickname of ""Flagpole"" Wilson by climbing a flagpole during 1956 anti-integration riots at the University of Alabama to shout, ""Keep 'Bama white!""

A few months later, at the organization’s 2013 annual conference in Winston-Salem, N.C., Bill Lord addressed a crowd of around 75 attendees, imploring them to think locally and “get you some bigots together and take some organizations over.” Lord, who was then the chairman of the Carroll County Democratic Party in Mississippi, was referring to positions such as the school board. He then went on to refer to Greenwood, Miss., as “the Congo” because of its large black population. The gathering only went further sideways from there, with Keith Alexander of the “Political Cesspool,” a racist and anti-Semitic far-right radio program, decrying Jewish political power and influence before stating, “The only people who can be trusted to be in charge are white people.” Another attendee, John Shudlick, five-time mayor of Ocean Ridge, Fla., encouraged the crowd to use critical thinking in the struggle for the country’s soul. According to Shudlick, the “six million figure [Jews killed in the holocaust] is a dirty filthy lie.”

In November of the same year, the CCC and the neo-Confederate League of the South held their first joint protest together against the removal of a statue of Tom Watson, an infamous racist and anti-Semite known for playing a key role in instigating the lynching of Leo Frank in 1915, from the steps of the Georgia state Capitol. The two groups’ membership rolls overlap a good deal; however, this event was demonstrative of the CCC’s longstanding strategy, focused on small, local rallies, being adopted by other hate groups.

Gordon Baum, the CCC’s founder and longtime leader, died at the age of 74 in early March 2015, leaving the future of the CCC uncertain. However, Baum’s death did little to slow down the activities of several of the group’s board members. Just weeks later, Jared Taylor and Sam Dickson, both well-known racist activists, appeared as speakers at the Russian Conservative Forum in St. Petersburg, Russia, alongside some of Europe’s most extreme, right-wing fringe.

Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy.""

The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).

Smythe worked as an economist for the Department of Agriculture from 1934-1947, for the Central Statistics Board from 1937-1938, for the Department of Labor from 1938-1941, and for the Federal Communications Commission from 1943-1948.  In 1948, Smythe joined the newly created Institute for Communications Research at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  In 1963, he took a position at the University of Saskatchewan where he worked until 1973 when he became Chair of the Communication Department at Simon Fraser University.

Smythe's scholarship focused primarily on mass media and telecommunications, and he is widely viewed as a pioneer of the political economy of communications tradition of communication scholarship.  Smythe's scholarship was informed by Marxism, and he remained politically active outside of academia for most of his life.  Of particular note is his involvement with the American League Against War and Fascism (also known as the American League for Peace and Democracy).  Because of his activism and his scholarship, particularly during the McCarthy era and beyond, Smythe claimed that his activities were being tracked by U.S. intelligence agencies.  In fact, during his application to (and eventual hire at) the University of Illinois, reports suggest that J. Edgar Hoover refused to release his FBI files to the university administration.  As a result, the attorney general intervened, and Smythe received the job.

If for any reason any portion of this request is denied, please provide written notice of the records that were withheld, and the specific legal justification for the denial. Please also provide the name and address of the officer(s) or body to which my appeal should be directed.

I also hereby request a waiver of both search and duplication fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(1l) and (a)(4XA)(iii). MuckRock is entitled to a waiver of search fees under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(11) because MuckRock is a member of the news media. cf. National Security Archive v. Department of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1387 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (defining news media within FOIA context).

MuckRock is a registered non-profit, collaborative news site that has recognized as been recognized by the Sunlight Foundation, The Freedom of the Press Foundation,the Global Investigative Journalism Network (https://gijn.org/member/muckrock/) (all of which expensively employ FOIA in their reporting).

MuckRock via it's website (muckrock.com) regularly obtains and publishes information about the operations and activities of government through FOIA and uses its editorial staff and contributors to turn this information into distinct works, and publishes and disseminates these works to the public. As it intends to do likewise with the records it receives in response to this inquest.

MuckRock also is entitled to a complete waiver of both search fees and duplication fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Under this provision: Records shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees established under clause (ii) if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4XAXiii).

In addition, if records are not produced within twenty (20) business days. Muckrock is entitled to a complete waiver of search and duplication fees under Section 6(b) of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, which amended FOR at 5 U.S.C. § (a)(4)(A)(viii).

MuckRock is a 501(c)(3), not-for-profit, educational organization, and, by definition, it has no commercial purpose. MuckRock exists to educate the public about the operations and activities of government, as well as to increase public understanding about the importance of ethics and the rule of law in government.

The particular records requested herein are sought as part of MuckRock's ongoing efforts to document the operations and activities of of government agencies and to educate the public about these operations and activities. Once MuckRock obtains the requested records, it intends to analyze them and disseminate the results of its analysis.

There is a clear public interest case in having these files released therefore I request fees be waived for the following reasons:

1) The questions raised about the government's motivations, integrity and judgment on this issue(s).

2) Any wrongdoing by the subject(s) in question, the government and/or other federal officials the materials may expose.

3) The subject is of ""widespread and exceptional media interest"" the widespread public interest and reporting on this case.

4) As a journalist and member of muckrock.com, I am engaged in reporting and disseminating information to the public, free of charge.

The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.

Schorr died peacefully from an apparent ""short illness"" on July 23, 2010, at a Washington, D.C. hospital.

In 1971, after a dispute with White House aides, Schorr's friends, neighbors, and co-workers were questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his habits. They were told that Schorr was under consideration for a high-level position in the environmental area. Schorr knew nothing about it. Later, during the Watergate hearings, it was revealed that Nixon aides had drawn up what became known as Nixon's Enemies List, and Daniel Schorr was on that list. Famously, Schorr read the list aloud on live TV, surprised to be reading his own name in that context. 

Schorr provoked intense controversy in 1976 when he received and made public the contents of the secret Pike Committee report on illegal Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and FBI activities. Called to testify before Congress, he refused to identify his source on First Amendment grounds, risking imprisonment. This did not mollify CBS executives, and Schorr ultimately resigned from his position at CBS in September 1976. Although scolded at first for his television report by former CIA director Richard Helms, Schorr was vindicated by the text of the Pike Committee, which he obtained from an undisclosed source and sent to The Village Voice.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.","1379793-0, DOJ-AP-2019-002042",FALSE,1439,460,Subjects Matter: FBI Files,,0.00,2017-07-08 04:00:00+00:00,2017-08-04,2020-03-13 04:56:00+00:00,daniel-schorr-39752

He came to public attention in July 2003 when an unauthorised discussion he had off the record with BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan about the British government's dossier on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was cited by Gilligan and led to a major controversy. Kelly's name became known to the media as Gilligan's source and he was called to appear on 15 July before a parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee investigating the issues Gilligan had reported. Kelly was questioned aggressively about his actions. He was found dead two days later.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair's government set up the Hutton Inquiry, a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death. The inquiry concluded that Kelly had committed suicide, with the cause of death as ""haemorrhage due to incised wounds of the left wrist"" in combination with ""coproxamol ingestion and coronary artery atherosclerosis"". Lord Hutton also decided that evidence related to the death, including the post-mortem report and photographs of the body, should remain classified for 70 years. In October 2010, Hutton claimed that he had done so to protect Kelly's wife and daughters from the distress of further media reports about the death, saying: ""My request was not a concealment of evidence because every matter of relevance had been examined or was available for examination during the public inquiry. There was no secrecy surrounding the postmortem report because it had always been available for examination and questioning by counsel representing the interested parties during the inquiry.""

In 2009 a group of British doctors who had not had access to the evidence—including Michael Powers, a physician, barrister, and former coroner—challenged Hutton's verdict, offering their opinion based on published reports that the cause of death was untenable; they argued that the artery is small and difficult to access, and severing it would not have triggered sufficient blood loss to cause death. This opinion was challenged by several forensic pathologists who also had not had access to the evidence, who told The Guardian that the combination of Kelly's heart disease and the overdose would have meant a smaller loss of blood could have killed him than would be needed to kill a healthier person. In August 2010 the former leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, called for a full inquest, and Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General for England and Wales, confirmed that he was considering re-opening it.

In October 2010, the postmortem—including the pathologist's 14-page report and the six-page toxicology report—was made public, reiterating the conclusion of the Hutton report. Powers maintains that questions remain about the amount of blood found at the scene and the number of pills taken.",1382160-000,FALSE,1406,1080,Subjects Matter: FBI Files,,0.00,2017-08-10 04:00:00+00:00,2017-09-08,2018-07-02 04:56:00+00:00,david-kelly-41701

Desmond Patrick Costello (31 January 1912 – 23 February 1964) was a New Zealand linguist, soldier, diplomat, university professor who was accused of being an agent for the Soviet GRU and of having sparked the first in a series of spy scandals in the 1960s which brought down the Macmillan government in the UK.

He was born in Auckland, New Zealand.

Eminent New Zealand author Sir James McNeish researched and wrote a biography of Paddy Costello entitled The Sixth Man: the extraordinary life of Paddy Costello (Random House, 2007). In the preface to this book, Philip Knightley writes that ""This long overdue biography sets the record straight. It convincingly shows that the slim evidence for the traitor charge was invented, exaggerated and misinterpreted."" Costello's MI5 file was released to the public in April 2017, but it fails to settle the issue of his supposed treachery.

Note that I am looking for information on the origins, use or assignment of the term ESP-X for FBI files, such as in the ""Majestic 12"" file posted to the FBI website. Note that a CRS search alone will not count as reasonably and carefully calculated to locate the records, as I am not requesting records on a single case.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.

EmmaBest,European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO),Completed,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/european-american-unity-and-rights-organization-euro-31226/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO). Founded in 2000 under a different name by the former Klan leader and notorious neo-Nazi David Duke, the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO) claims to fight for ""White Civil Rights"" for ""European and Americans Wherever They May Live."" Beyond hosting a website, whitecivilrights.com, and staging an occasional conference, EURO is a paper tiger, serving primarily as a vehicle to publicize Duke's writing and sell his books. 

In January of 2000, David Duke announced that he was creating a new organization to help protect the rights and heritage of European Americans. The group, NOFEAR (the National Organization for European American Rights), was modeled on civil rights groups like the NAACP and the National Council of La Raza and meant to fight against what Duke argued was widespread discrimination against whites by minorities. Duke told reporters in 2000 that white people in America were facing a ""genocide,"" and wrote in letter to the Shreveport Times that European Americans were ""internally displaced people"" deserving of refugee status and government protection. In 2001, a lawsuit was filed against Duke for trademark infringement by No Fear Inc., a sportswear company. To avoid legal action, Duke changed the name of his organization to EURO. 

EURO's founder had far more serious problems with the law. An investigation of Duke for mail fraud prompted a federal raid on his two-story house in Mandeville, La. On Nov. 16, 2000, federal agents carted away 22 boxes of papers, computer discs, credit card records and other documents. At the time, Duke was in Russia on his fourth visit. From a safe distance, Duke insisted on his innocence. ""Make no mistake about it,"" he wrote in a NOFEAR newsletter, ""this probe is nothing more than a political assassination on the part of government officials who are seeking to silence my voice on our European heritage and rights."" In the meantime, Duke said, he was moving to Moscow ""to struggle against people of other colors and Jews."" It is clear that Duke understood perfectly that he was in trouble back home. That's why he spent the next two years traveling in Russia and throughout Europe giving speeches and hobnobbing with other extremists. Overall, Duke sought to give the impression that he was devoted to building a transnational white rights movement. The reality, however, was that Duke spent most of his time selling books, meeting privately with prominent extremists, and giving paid talks. 

By late 2002, Duke's attorney was negotiating a plea agreement for his client, who had grown tired of being a nationalist without a nation. When news of the plea became public, Bruce ""Vince"" Breeding, an important figure in the National Alliance and by then the national director of EURO, said Duke was pleading because he would surely lose in court at the hands of a mostly black jury. EURO communiqués painted the group's founder as ""a living martyr for our cause."" 

On Dec. 14, Duke pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud — raising money under false pretenses that was later spent on personal investments or lost at the craps tables in three states — and another of making false statements on his tax return by vastly understating his 1998 income. Under terms of the plea agreement, signed by Duke, his lawyer and Assistant U.S. Attorney Carter Guice, he was sentenced to one-and-a-half years in federal prison in 2003.

While Duke was incarcerated, Breeding continued to run EURO, posting entries by noted white supremacists on its website and carrying on Duke's efforts to rescue white people from the alleged depravity of the Jews and other minority groups. Yet, as a 2003 Intelligence Report exposé revealed, Breeding was simultaneously running a New Orleans-based porn site, the now defunct xsitenola.com, while producing a companion adult magazine, Xsite. Given the straight-arrow reputation of the National Alliance and Duke's pretensions to being a sophisticated intellectual, Breeding's sleazy side job proved to be embarrassing for the movement. (It didn't help that his magazine advertised an escort service specializing in women of color, a definite no-no for neo-Nazis.) In late 2003, Breeding quit his job as the national director of EURO. Fifty-four-year-old Kenny Knight, a former leader in Duke's National Association for the Advancement of White People and a member of the Council of Conservative Citizens hate group, was named Breeding's successor. 

Over the 2004 Memorial Day weekend, Duke was welcomed back from his stay in prison with a well-attended racist unity conference in Louisiana, co-sponsored by EURO and several other hate groups including the National Alliance, the Council of Conservative Citizens and the Holocaust-denying Barnes Review. Several white-supremacist leaders signed Duke's ""New Orleans Protocol,"" a set of principles ""pledging adherents to a pan-European outlook"" — and, ironically enough, to ""honorable and ethical behavior."" An estimated 67,000 racists from around the world logged onto EURO's website for a simulcast of the main festivities. 

In recent years, EURO has accomplished little. Its website still posts articles decrying the fate of white people in America and calls for ""Equal Rights for Whites"" and the ""Preservation of Our European-American Heritage."" But it mostly serves as a link to Duke's own site, www.duke.org, where visitors can view his articles, listen to his radio programs, and buy his merchandise. 

In 2008, EURO did add one arrow to its quiver. While announcing plans to hold another conference, this time in Memphis, the group also noted that Ed Fields, the aged and longtime segregationist, had quit publishing his newspaper, The Thunderbolt, and joined up with Duke. Duke's newsletter said that the move would double both the size of EURO and the number of subscribers to The Duke Report.

My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.",1363736-000,FALSE,1636,1485,Haters: Documenting Extremist and Hate Groups,,0.00,2016-12-23 05:00:00+00:00,2017-01-25,2017-05-02 00:00:00+00:00,european-american-unity-and-rights-organization-euro-31226

A November 15th, 1962, article in the Coe Cosmos campus newspaper describes the creation of this group and described an upcoming meeting on November 16th. What follows is a copy of an article describing the group an their activities in 1962:

""On October 26 a group of students interested in civil rights and peace got together and organized the Committee on National and International Affairs (COINA). The purpose of this group is to discuss ways to peace and disarmament and promote action on civil rights. A temporary planning committee consisting of Barbara Steidemann, Chairman; Jim Ruffins, Lucien Cerwin, Charles Vosseler, Jon Duerr, and Carolyn Bunte was appointed to map out future programs from the group. At the first meeting Mr. William Higgs of Mississippi, who was James Meredith's lawyer, was the resource speaker. He emphasized the need to have student groups actively concerned with the problem of race relations and also the need for fundraising campaigns to support national groups such as SNCC and CORE. This Friday CONIA will present a program dealing with the other side of its purpose, peace and disarmament. Mr. Larry Martin from the American Friends Service Committee will show a film ""Which Way the Wind."" This is a play written by the AFSC which dramatically presents the issue of peace in a nuclear age. All students are urged to attend this meeting which will be held Friday, November 16, at 7:30 in the TUB conference room.""

Here is a link to a cached version of the article from Newspapers.com: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Jwr4oH0fE2kJ:https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/32705676/&hl=en&gl=ge&strip=1&vwsrc=0

One of the participants in this group was CHARLES MARTIN VOSSELER who is currently a criminal wanted by the FBI. Vosseler's participation in this meeting does not appear to be common knowledge, and information about this 1960s-era civil rights group is virtually non existent on the internet. Vosseler's participation in the group appears to go against his later activities when he lived in close proximity to a white supremacist community in Oklahoma.

Since then, our staff members have participated in two briefings with FBI officials, and at the most recent session they learned that the FBI recently changed its policy with respect to the type of legal process that it typically seeks before employing this type of technology.  According to this new policy, the FBI now obtains a search warrant before deploying a cell-site simulator, although the policy contains a number of potentially broad exceptions and we continue to have questions about how it is being implemented in practice.  Furthermore, it remains unclear how other agencies within the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security make use of cell-site simulators and what policies are in place to govern their use of that technology. [....] For example, we understand that the FBI’s new policy requires FBI agents to obtain a search warrant whenever a cell-site simulator is used as part of a FBI investigation or operation, unless one of several exceptions apply, including (among others): (1) cases that pose an imminent danger to public safety, (2) cases that involve a fugitive, or (3) cases in which the technology is used in public places or other locations at which the FBI deems there is no reasonable expectation of privacy.""",DOJ-AP-2016- 003982; 1330154-000,FALSE,2211,1741,The Spy In Your Pocket,,0.00,2015-05-28 04:00:00+00:00,2015-06-25,2016-05-31 00:00:00+00:00,fbi-new-stingray-policy-18167

As stated on the FBI website, acceptable proof of death includes 'an FBI file that indicates a person is deceased.' These individuals are listed as deceased in your Bureau's RIDS 'Dead List' of FBI files on deceased individuals. The files were originally part of the 'FBI OFFICIALS' index/list. For your convenience, a copy of the 'Dead List' may be viewed at https://archive.org/details/FBIRIDsDeadList2015 in a variety of formats. 

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written on the U.S. Intelligence Community, succinctly describing and analyzing events such as the Nosenko affair. These articles have been widely disseminated, with analytics reporting over 100,000 readers for a single article on Yuri Nosenko. 

I request that all fees be waived. Since the files are about FBI officials and representatives of the US government, it clearly concerns the operations or activities of the US Government. I believe that the disclosure is informative and will help the public understand the operations and activities of the US Government, particularly the people responsible for those operations and activities. Specifically since the files describe FBI personnel and operations, the disclosure will contribute significantly to public understanding of FBI personnel and operations, as well as the history of the Bureau itself. The requested documents will be made freely available to other members of the news media as well as the general public and uploaded to the National Security collection of the non-profit Internet Archive.

FAIR leaders have ties to white supremacist groups and eugenicists and have made many racist statements. Its advertisements have been rejected because of racist content. FAIR’s founder, John Tanton, has expressed his wish that America remain a majority-white population: a goal to be achieved, presumably, by limiting the number of nonwhites who enter the country. One of the group’s main goals is upending the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a decades-long, racist quota system that limited immigration mostly to northern Europeans. FAIR President Dan Stein has called the Act a ""mistake.""

John Tanton founded the Federation for American Immigration Reform on Jan. 2, 1979, in Washington D.C. Roger Conner, an environmental lawyer, was appointed executive director, while Tanton served as the chairman of the board of directors. Before establishing FAIR, Tanton had experience working with groups concerned about how population growth affected the environment. Tanton served in several Sierra Club leadership posts, and he had been the president of Zero Population Growth, a group founded by biologist and longtime FAIR adviser Paul Ehrlich, from 1975 to 1977.

The founding of FAIR was a major change for Tanton. But he was driven to shift his efforts to the battle against immigration by his increasing concern that it was the primary cause of population growth. As a result, FAIR focuses exclusively on immigration issues. Its goal, according to its website, is to set immigration quotas ""at the lowest feasible levels"" and to prevent all illegal immigration. The group attempts to appear moderate, even though its record is extreme, particularly on racial issues. This strategy has paid off: In August 2009, FAIR President Dan Stein boasted that FAIR leaders had testified before Congress about 100 times.

In its early years, FAIR was known for frequent op-ed pieces and controversial advertisements. In December 1980, it ran an ad in the Rocky Mountain News with the headline: ""Our Grandparents Came To America To Escape Poverty And Despair. Will Our Children Want To Leave For The Same Reasons?"" The implication was that unless immigration policies were reformed, immigrants would swarm the United States, undermine job prospects for Americans and put an end to American prosperity.

In 1988, Dan Stein replaced Roger Conner as executive director. Stein had been an employee of FAIR since 1982; before that, he was the executive director of the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI), which was incorporated under FAIR's tax exemption and still serves as FAIR's legal arm. Conner became FAIR's president; this meant that Stein took over the responsibilities of running FAIR while Conner focused on fundraising.

On Oct. 9, 1988, the Arizona Republic published excerpts from embarrassing memos that had been sent by Tanton and Conner to members of FAIR's leadership. The documents were known as the WITAN memos; they came from an October 1986 conference in which Tanton met with a number of anti-immigration activists for a strategy session. The memos revealed Tanton's innermost, and controversial, thoughts. Tanton warned of a ""Latin onslaught,"" complained of Latinos' allegedly low ""educability."" He asked, ""Will Latin American migrants bring with them the tradition of the mordida (bribe), the lack of involvement in public affairs, etc.?"" He also wondered: ""Can homo contraceptivus [meaning whites] compete with homo progenitiva [meaning Latinos] if borders aren't controlled? Or is advice to limit ones [sic] family simply advice to move over and let someone else with greater reproductive powers occupy the space?""

In the memos, Tanton, sounding much like the Klan of the 1920s, expressed concerns over the role of the Catholic Church in the United States, a favorite topic of his. He worried that the Church would capitalize on the Catholic faith of Latino immigrants to exert more political influence in the U.S. Specifically, he thought the church would try to subvert the division between church and state and limit abortion and birth control.

Linda Chavez, then the executive director of another group founded by John Tanton and of which he was then president, U.S. English, resigned because of the memos, calling them ""repugnant and not excusable"" and ""anti-Catholic and anti-Hispanic."" Several members of U.S. English's board, including Walter Cronkite and Arnold Schwarzenegger, also quit the group, and Tanton resigned. But there was no fallout for Tanton with his colleagues at FAIR; there, Tanton was supported and a committee created to craft his defense for the incendiary comments in the WITAN memos.

The memos were far from the sum of Tanton's extremism. As reports by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) would document, Tanton has a lengthy record of friendly correspondence with Holocaust deniers, a former Klan lawyer and leading white nationalist thinkers, including Jared Taylor (who wrote in 2005, ""When blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western civilization — any kind of civilization — disappears""). On another occasion, Tanton wrote a major FAIR funder to suggest she read the work of radical anti-Semitic professor Kevin MacDonald— to ""give you a new understanding of the Jewish outlook on life"" — and suggested that the entire FAIR board discuss the man's theories about the Jews. In a letter to FAIR board member Donald Collins, Tanton enthused over the work of John Trevor Sr. — a key architect of the bluntly racist Immigration Act of 1924 and a man who distributed pro-Nazi propaganda and warned shrilly of ""diabolical Jewish control"" of America — and said it should serve FAIR as ""a guidepost to what we must follow again this time."" Tanton has also made several racist comments, telling a reporter in 1997 that unless U.S. borders are sealed, America will be overrun by people ""defecating and creating garbage and looking for jobs.""

The WITAN memos reveal Tanton's keen awareness of the importance of seeming respectable. In one memo, he wrote: ""the issues we're touching on here must be broached by liberals. The conservatives simply cannot do it without tainting the whole subject."" But the publication of the memos did not halt FAIR's growth. In 1990, FAIR claimed 50,000 members.

Tanton's preoccupation with immigration appears to be based, at least in part, on race. In a March 3, 1993 memo to FAIR board member Otis Graham, he demonstrated his desire to limit the number of nonwhites living in the U.S. The memo concerned a new group Tanton wanted to start, which he would have named the League for European American Defense, Education, and Research, or LEADERs [sic].   According to another Tanton memo, he had hatched the idea with help from three prominent white nationalists: the Council of Conservative Citizens' Sam Francis, American Renaissance's Jared Taylor and Wayne Lutton, who edits Tanton's hate journal The Social Contract. Tanton wrote in his LEADERs memo: ""Projections by the U.S. Census Bureau show that midway into the next century, the current European-American majority will become a minority … This is unacceptable; we decline to bequeath to our children minority status in their own land."" Here, Tanton made it quite clear that the skin color of immigrants factored into his desire to limit immigration.

Despite Tanton's unsavory track record, longtime FAIR President Dan Stein has shrunk from any criticism of FAIR's founder; on the contrary, in 2009 he told the Washington Post that Tanton was a ""Renaissance man.""

Maybe Stein has vigorously defended Tanton because he has expressed similarly extreme positions. In 1991, Stein sent a report to FAIR's board of directors under the subject line: ""The Defenders of American culture Rise to the Call to Arms."" In the memo, which is archived at George Washington University's Gelman Library, Stein celebrated a new ""disdain"" in the media and among intellectuals for ""the political agenda of those who openly attack the contributions of Western Civilization."" He was particularly happy that ""multicultural and Politically Correct"" school curricula had come under criticism.

Stein's report expressed the hope that mounting criticism of multiculturalism would eventually lead to attacks on the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended years of racist immigration policy (under a national origins quota system heavily skewed against non-whites and even darker-skinned Europeans) and initiated a wave of non-white immigration to the U.S. For Stein, the 1965 Act was ""a key mistake in national policy"" and a ""source of error.""

In 1994, Tanton interviewed Stein for FAIR's oral history project, which is composed of transcribed audio interviews with about a dozen FAIR principals. In that interview, Stein again expressed his disgust for the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. He told Tanton that those who supported the 1965 reform wanted to ""retaliate against Anglo-Saxon dominance"" and that this ""revengism"" against whites had created a policy that is causing ""chaos and will continue to create chaos.""

Between 1985 and 1994, FAIR received around $1.2 million in grants from the Pioneer Fund. The Pioneer Fund is a eugenicist organization that was started in 1937 by men close to the Nazi regime who wanted to pursue ""race betterment"" by promoting the genetic lines of American whites. Now led by race scientist J. Philippe Rushton, the fund continues to back studies intended to reveal the inferiority of minorities to whites.

FAIR stopped receiving Pioneer Fund grants in 1994 due to bad publicity it received when the grants were made public. At the time, FAIR was backing California's punishing anti-immigrant Proposition 187, which would have denied education and health care to the children of undocumented immigrants in that state if it had not died as the result of court challenges. Stein and Tanton had led FAIR's efforts to win funding from Pioneer, and Stein said in 1993, before Pioneer's extremism was made public, that his ""job [was] to get every dime of Pioneer's money.""

After the bad publicity, FAIR denied that the Pioneer Fund money had any influence on its work or in any way influenced its programs. To manage the fallout, on March 16, 1994, Stein wrote a letter to Harry Weyher, then the president of the Pioneer Fund. Stein attached a draft of a document that he wanted Weyher to endorse and send out, titled ""Why the Pioneer Fund Supports the Immigration Reform Movement."" Stein wrote the piece as though Weyher had written it himself. One part read, ""We are pleased and proud that through financial support, we've made FAIR's important work possible."" Though FAIR stopped receiving grants from the fund, which require public disclosure, it continued to receive private financial support from Pioneer's leaders for several years. In early 1997, Tanton organized a gathering at the New York Racquet and Tennis Club, where three members of FAIR's board — Henry Buhl, Sharon Barnes and Alan Weeden — met with Harry Weyher. In the late 1990s, Tanton also vacationed with Pioneer Fund board member John Trevor Jr., who also provided private financial support to FAIR.

FAIR also has produced controversial media programming. In 1996, FAIR started a television program called ""Borderline."" The show lasted for about a year and featured a number of prominent white nationalists, including Sam Francis and Jared Taylor. ""Borderline"" often advanced ideas popular in white nationalist circles; particularly popular was the idea that immigrants are destroying American culture or displacing Western civilization with degenerate, Third World ways.

Lawrence Auster, a white nationalist who spoke in 1996 to a conference put on by American Renaissance and whose website ""A View from the Right"" is listed as a hate site by the SPLC, appeared on the show on April 1, 1996, making the argument that if the U.S. loses its white majority, it will be destroyed. The topic that day, according to host Dan Stein, was to ""take a politically incorrect look at American culture and Western Civilization."" Stein added, ""America, love it or lose it."" Auster argued that because of an ""invasion,"" ""America is in the process of dissolving as a nation."" Supposedly drawing on history, Auster warned that as demographic change occurs and ""the majority is threatened in its position,"" the result could be ""civil war."" Auster's particular concern that day was the loss of ""the historic European Anglo American culture."" Stein certainly seemed to agree with his guest's worries. ""How can we preserve America if it becomes 50% Latin American?"" he asked. Stein also said that Anglos were leaving Los Angeles because it had become ""a foreign country to them.""

Another prominent white nationalist who appeared on ""Borderline"" was naturalized English immigrant Peter Brimelow, who in 1999 would go on to found the anti-immigrant hate site VDARE.com. Brimelow authored Alien Nation, a book that argues America should remain white-dominated. In a discussion about Alien Nation on Aug. 5, 1996, Stein asked Brimelow whether ""America's social and economic elites seem to be writing off the whole idea of the nation-state."" He added: ""If they shift their loyalty from the nation-state, what are they loyal to?"" Brimelow argued that these same elites are creating the ""greatest transformation of any independent state in history"" by bringing in ""new minority groups that did not exist before."" Brimelow considered these elites to be ""treasonous,"" people who ""hate our traditional culture and they see immigration as a weapon to help destroy it."" ""Are they really patriots?"" Brimelow asked.

Stein asked Brimelow to talk more about his statement ""race is destiny in American politics."" Brimelow did, saying, ""you really alter the texture of the country by bringing in different ethnic groups."" Endorsing the invasion theory, Brimelow told one caller, ""you have areas of South Texas and so on that have essentially gone back to Mexico."" Stein later asked Brimelow whether this all meant ""the end of the United States?"" Brimelow's answer: ""Sure.""

In 1998, various nativists and nativist groups attempted to get the Sierra Club to take an anti-immigration stance. The effort culminated in a 1998 vote in which Sierra Club members determined whether the group would support immigration restrictions. FAIR was one of the groups that helped to put the measure on the Sierra Club ballot, and Dan Stein teamed up with then-CNN Crossfire host Pat Buchanan to advocate for it. Members ultimately chose to retain the Sierra Club's neutral stance on immigration policy in a 60%-40% vote. The Sierra Club was an important target for FAIR because it was considered a liberal group, and Tanton, who held leadership positions there in the 1970s and still had many allies, expressed in his WITAN memos that he thought that the Sierra Club would be less vulnerable to charges of racism when advocating against immigration.

In April 1999, FAIR attacked U.S. Senator Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) for supporting more visas for foreigners with technology skills. It ran a newspaper ad that placed a picture of Abraham, an Arab-American, alongside a picture of Osama bin Laden. It asked, ""Why Is a U.S. Senator Trying to Make It Easier for Osama bin Laden to Export Terrorism to the U.S.?"" FAIR's ads were widely condemned and caused former Senator Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) to resign from FAIR's advisory board. FAIR has also run other extremely controversial political advertisements, including one in 2000 in Iowa that was rejected by a TV station as ""borderline racist.""

Several FAIR officials have links to white supremacist hate groups. Rick Oltman, who for much of the 1990s was FAIR's western regional coordinator, spoke as part of a 1997 immigration panel sponsored by the Council of Conservative Citizens, a racist group that has described black people as a ""retrograde species of humanity."" Council publications at the time listed Oltman as a member. Jim Staudenraus, FAIR's eastern regional coordinator, participated in an anti-immigration conference in 2002 with white nationalist Jared Taylor. In 2007, a senior FAIR official met with leaders of Vlaams Belang, a Belgian political party that officials in that country outlawed in a previous incarnation (Vlaams Blok) as a ""criminal organization"" because of its racist, anti-immigrant views.

In late 2006, FAIR hired Joseph Turner as its western field representative after Oltman departed. Turner was the founder of the Southern California group Save Our State, a now-defunct anti-immigrant hate group that was known for attracting neo-Nazis to its rallies. Turner was on record before joining FAIR as saying that being a white separatist did not imply a person was racist. Turner once accused Mexican immigrants of turning California into a ""third world cesspool."" He left FAIR in December 2007 shortly after the SPLC, in tandem with publishing an extensive report on the group's racism that included Turner's inflammatory comments, designated FAIR as a hate group. FAIR representatives did not comment as to the reason for Turner's departure.
 
FAIR board members harbor extreme views and connections as well. Garrett Hardin, a now-deceased biologist, was a very close friend of Tanton's and an active board member of FAIR from the mid-1980s until around 1996. Like Tanton, he often expressed eugenicist views. Hardin was a longtime supporter of population control: In 1968, he wrote ""The Tragedy of the Commons,"" in which he argued that ""[the] freedom to breed is intolerable."" In a 1992 interview with Omni magazine, he argued against sending food to starving Ethiopians, noting that doing so would only ""encourage population growth."" In that interview, he lauded China for its ""one-child policy"" but lamented that the policy was not thorough enough. Former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm, a longtime member of FAIR's board of advisors, once said that ""new cultures"" in America were ""diluting what we are and who we are.""

Longtime FAIR board member Donald A. Collins writes frequently for the VDARE.com, an anti-immigrant hate site named after Virginia Dare, said to have been the first English child born in the New World. (VDARE is dedicated to bashing immigrants and has published the work of many white nationalists and anti-Semites.) Collins has been published in The Journal of Social, Political and Economic Studies, a journal run by eugenicist Roger Pearson. Collins' articles have focused on attacking the Catholic Church for its liberal stance on immigration. One accused Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony of selling out his country ""in exchange for more temporal power and glory."" Another claimed bishops were ""infiltrating and manipulating the American political process"" to dismantle the separation of church and state — the classic calumny directed at American Catholics for decades by the Klan and others. Another person linked to VDARE is Joe Guzzardi, a member of FAIR's board of advisors who worked as an editor of the site.

On Oct. 2, 2007, Julie Kirchner became FAIR's third executive director. Dan Stein had taken the position of FAIR president by that time. Stein retained his status as leader and public face of FAIR, while Kirchner managed the day-to-day operations.

In the late 2000s, FAIR become much more active in pushing anti-immigrant laws at the state and local level. Attorney Kris Kobach, who works for FAIR's legal arm, the Immigration Reform Law Institute, helped to write Arizona Senate Bill 1070. The bill, signed by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer on April 23, 2010, forces police officers to detain individuals who they suspect to be illegal immigrants and makes it a misdemeanor under state law for non-citizen immigrants to fail to carry their immigration papers. The law is currently caught up in the federal courts. Kobach earlier helped to pass anti-immigrant ordinances in Farmers Branch, Texas; Hazleton, Pa.; and other cities. These laws seek to punish those who aid and abet ""illegal aliens."" The laws have proven a massive financial burden to the towns that pass them and, in many cases, have sparked racial strife and economic disorder. The Hazleton ordinance, which was struck down by a federal appeals court in September, had left that community of about 20,000 on the hook for nearly $3 million in legal fees as of January 2011. The city is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Another FAIR initiative to end birthright citizenship provisions of the 14th Amendment, a longtime goal of the group, was launched in January 2011. IRLI, FAIR's legal arm, working in partnership with State Legislators for Legal Immigration (SLLI), announced a plan to halt what they call ""the misapplication of the 14th Amendment."" At the time of its adoption in 1868, the 14th Amendment ensured that the children of slaves could not be denied citizenship; it now ensures that almost all children born on U.S. soil are automatically granted U.S. citizenship.

SLLI is a coalition of about 70 legislators in 38 states dedicated to eliminating ""economic attractions"" for immigrants and their ""unlawful invasion"" of the U.S. The group is often described as the legislative arm of FAIR, which is apt given the group says on its website that it has a ""working partnership"" with FAIR. SLLI's legislators are the main instigators behind favored FAIR initiatives, including attempts at the state level to deny immigrants various rights through laws modeled on Arizona's S.B. 1070.

SLLI has grown dormant in recent years, and the Supreme Court in 2012 struck down most of SB 1070’s provisions as unconstitutional.

The 2012 election saw a renewed push for immigration reform at the federal level, with a bipartisan bill passing the Senate before collapsing in the House. In an effort to stop reform legislation, anti-immigrant front groups first created with the help of FAIR in the mid-2000s were revived and rebranded. Groups like Choose Black America and You Don’t Think for Me were replaced by the African American Leadership Council (AALC), a name replaced quickly by the Black American Leadership Alliance (BALA), and Alliance for Immigration Justice (AIJ). These groups, which ostensibly opposed reform because it would damage job prospects for minorities and hurt taxpayers, were made up of African Americans and Latinos. Many of them – such as Leah Durant, a former staffer at IRLI (FAIR’s legal arm), and Frank Morris, a longtime FAIR board member – had close ties to nativist organizations. BALA did manage to organize a rally in Washington – the “DC March for Jobs” – that brought together a few thousand activists, including some nativist extremists like D.A. King of Georgia.

Following the failure of reform legislation, FAIR found a new focus. As the number of children fleeing violence in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua spiked in the summer of 2014, FAIR and its allies began to target organizations aiding these unaccompanied minors. FAIR published a map on its website with the title, “Is the Border Crisis Coming to a Town Near You?” It named locales where minors were being resettled and the organizations helping in that effort. Protests organized by anti-immigrant activists took place in a number of locations, most infamously in Murrieta, California, where activists blocked a bus full of women and children on their way to an immigration-processing center. In Michigan, anti-Muslim activist Tamyra Murray, a state adviser for FAIR, organized a protest against the relocation of minors in Vassar.

Even without a major immigration reform bill to challenge, FAIR’s public statements in recent years show that the organization remains true to the white nationalist principles on which it was founded. In late December 2015, Dan Stein told supporters in a video message that without a moratorium on immigration, “we’re going to lose everything about what it means to be an American.”

In addition to Bureau/Office FOIA Officers, some bureaus/offices also have Regional FOIA Coordinators and Field Offices that process requests. Some bureaus/offices have their program offices (i.e., the offices whose records are the subject of the requests) prepare the responses to FOIA requests.

This letter constitutes a request under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (collectively, “FOIA/PA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 552, 552a, and the Department of Justice’s (“DOJ”) implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 16, by independent journalist Joshua Eaton. For purposes of this request, the definition of “records” includes, but is not limited to, documents, letters, faxes, memoranda, notes, reports, e-mail messages (including e-mails to and from personal e-mail accounts), other correspondence, orders, policy statements, data, technical evaluations or analysis, and studies. The definition of “records” expressly refers to materials already in existence, whether in physical or electronic form, and does not imply any need for DOJ to create new records.

A. Request for disclosure

I seek disclosure of any and all records or communications created from Jan. 8, 1947, to the date your office processes this request, inclusive, that were prepared, received, transmitted, collected, and/or maintained by the FBI relating or referring to David Robert Jones a/k/a David Bowie (born Jan. 8, 1947, in Brixton, London, U.K, and died Jan. 10, 2016, in New York City, N.Y., U.S.A.).

I request these records pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 16.3(a)(4) (""Where a request for records pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by ... submitting proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary)""). Mr. Jones died on Jan. 10. 2016, as reported in the New York Times and other media outlets. See John Pareles, ""David Bowie dies at 69; he transcended music, art and fashion,"" New York Times (Jan. 11, 2016), http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/arts/music/david-bowie-dies-at-69.html; Tara Bahrampour, ""David Bowie dies at 69; mesmerizing performer and restless innovator,"" Washington Post (Jan. 11, 2016), https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/singer-david-bowie-dies-at-69-mesmerizing-performer-of-many-alter-egos/2016/01/11/e133f63c-b859-11e5-99f3-184bc379b12d_story.html.

B. Search parameters

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.

C. Request for limitation of processing fees

I request a limitation of processing fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) (“fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by ... a representative of the news media”) and 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.11(c)(1)(i) and 16.11(d)(1) (“Search fees shall be charged for all requests — other than requests made by … representatives of the news media,” and “No search fee will be charged for requests by … representatives of the news media”). As a “representative of the news media,” I fit within this statutory and regulatory exemption. Fees associated with the processing of this request should, therefore, be limited accordingly.

I meet the definition of a “representative of the news media” because I am “an entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience.” See National Security Archive v. Department of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1387 (D.C. Cir. 1989).

I am a full-time, professional journalist who reports on issues related to national security, cybersecurity, human rights and religion. My reporting on these topics has appeared in the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, the Christian Science Monitor, Al Jazeera America, Al Jazeera English, Public Radio International (PRI), Salon, GlobalPost, and other publications. In addition, I am a former digital producer at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting and the former editor-in-chief of Spare Change News, both located in Boston, Mass. A complete list of my publications and my full résumé are available online at https://joshuaeaton.net.

Although I am a freelance journalist, my ongoing professional relationship with editors at a number of outlets ensures any articles I write based on these documents will be published, demonstrating “a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization,” as required by the definition of “representative of the news media” in C.F.R. § 16.11 (b)(6). Under that same regulation, “components shall also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.” Id.

This request is made as part of the news-gathering process and not for commercial purposes. As such, I am entitled to a limitation of processing fees.

In the event that processing fees cannot be limited, please inform me of the anticipated total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

D. Request for fee waiver

I additionally request a waiver of all costs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) (“Documents shall be furnished without any charge ... if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester”) and C.F.R. § 16.11(k)(1) (“Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below that established … where a component determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that … Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and … Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester”). This request is made as part of the news-gathering process and not for commercial purposes. As such, I am entitled to a fee waiver.

Disclosure in this case meets the statutory criteria, and a fee waiver would fulfill Congress’s legislative intent in amending FOIA. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“Congress amended FOIA to ensure that it be ‘liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters.’”).

Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. This request will further public understanding of government conduct; specifically, the FBI’s monitoring, surveillance, and infiltration of organizations on the basis of organizational membership, political views or affiliation, or participation in protest activities or demonstrations. This type of government activity concretely affects many individuals and groups and implicates basic privacy, free speech, and associational rights protected by the Constitution.

Moreover, disclosure of the requested information will aid public understanding of the implications of the Department of Justice’s decision to relax guidelines that previously restricted the FBI’s ability to spy on organizations without a threshold showing of suspected criminal activity. These restrictions were created in response to the Hoover-era FBI’s surveillance of politically active individuals and organizations, despite the lack of evidence that such individuals and organizations had been involved in any unlawful behavior. Understanding the scope of the FBI’s surveillance and infiltration of law-abiding organizations is, therefore, crucial to the public’s interest in understanding the consequences of the Department of Justice’s important change in policy.

As a “representative of the news media,” supra Section C, I am well-situated to disseminate the information I gain from this request to the general public, to targeted communities, and to groups that protect constitutional rights. Because I meet the test for a fee waiver, fees associated with responding to my FOIA/PA requests should be – and regularly are – waived.

The records requested are not sought for commercial use. I plan to disseminate the information disclosed as a result of this FOIA/PA request through the channels

In the event that fees cannot be waived, please inform me of the anticipated total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

E. Miscellany

Pursuant to applicable regulations and statute, I expect the determination of this request for documents within 20 days of your receipt of this request. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i) and 28 C.F.R. § 16.5(d)(4).

If this request is denied, in whole or in part, please justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions to FOIA/PA. DOJ must also release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. I reserve the right to appeal any decision to withhold any information in whole or in part, to deny the request to limit processing fees, or to deny the request for a fee waiver.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,
Joshua Eaton",20163781,FALSE,1882,1489,,,0.00,2016-04-21 04:00:00+00:00,2016-05-19,,foiapa-request-prince-rogers-nelson-25351

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.",1367116-000,FALSE,1589,215,,,0.00,2017-02-08 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-09,2020-11-13 04:56:00+00:00,foia-portal-dev-33063
