The aggregate number of detections collected during 2017. 
The aggregate number of “hits” (i.e. times that a plate on a hotlist was detected) during 2016. 
The aggregate number of “hits” during 2017.

This information is easily available within the Agency’s LEARN system. The simplest way to extract this data is to generate a “Dashboard Hit Ratio Report” PDF file from within LEARN. We would prefer the data for each year to be provided separately.

Brigitte Tudor, better known as Brigitte Gabriel, founded ACT for America in 2007 at a time when the anti-Muslim movement America was beginning to take shape in the United States. In the years since, the group has grown to become the largest grassroots anti-Muslim group in America, claiming 280,000 members and over 1,000 chapters. Brigitte Gabriel claims ACT was launched as a response to the 9/11 attacks and “educates citizens and elected officials to impact policy involving national security and defeating terrorism.” Throughout its existence, ACT has stayed true to its mission by working to advance anti-Muslim legislation at the local and federal level while flooding the American public with wild hate speech demonizing Muslims.

Even before she created ACT, Gabriel, a Lebanese Christian who national turned American citizen, was vocally critical of Islam and Muslims and repeatedly made statements conflating all Muslims with terrorists. “Islamic terrorists … are really just very devout followers of Muhammad,” she wrote in 2006. “They are following his example and doing exactly what the Koran teaches and their mullahs exhort them to do.” In 2004, she angered a Jewish audience during a speech in which she reportedly referred to Arabs as “barbarians,” prompting a public apology from her hosts. In 2006 Gabriel released Because They Hate: A Survivor of Islamic Terror Warns America. The book was a call to action based on the “truth” behind Islam that Gabriel says she learned as a child during the civil war in Lebanon.

In 2007, Gabriel gave a lecture to the Defense Department’s Joint Forces Staff College as part a course on Islam. She reportedly told U.S. military and national security personnel that Muslims should be prohibited from serving in public office on the basis of their faith. “If a Muslim who has — who is — a practicing Muslim who believes the word of the Koran to be the word of Allah, who abides by Islam, who goes to mosque and prays every Friday, who prays five times a day — this practicing Muslim, who believes in the teachings of the Koran, cannot be a loyal citizen to the United States of America,” she said.

In 2008, a year after forming ACT, Gabriel published a second book, They Must Be Stopped: Why We Must Defeat Radical Islam and How We Can Do It.  A line from the book’s introduction read, “In the Muslim world, extreme is mainstream.”

In 2010, as the number of ACT chapters and members increased, the organization announced its first “National Conference and Legislative Briefing” which took place from that June in Washington, D.C. The conference brought together anti-Muslim leaders, ACT chapter activists and federal politicians to discuss concerns with Islam and Muslims under the guise of protecting national security. The legislative briefing segment of the conference was another indication of ACT’s budding ties with elected officials, with many of them talking time out of their schedules to talk to ACT members about pressing national security topics. At the 2010 conference, ACT presented its “Patriot Award” to U.S. Rep. Peter King of New York a champion of the anti-Muslim cause.

When presenting Rep. King with the award, Gabriel indicated how much ACT covets its relationships with elected officials and how critical they are to advancing ACT’s agenda. Gabriel told King, “I cannot tell you how much we appreciate you and how much we are dedicated to making your work on Capitol Hill easier by mobilizing the people and the public, especially in your state, to support you.” King responded, “I want you to know, as I said before, how much I appreciate the work that ACT for America does for our country. Because we are engaged in a brutal war against a brutal enemy, the enemy of Islamic terrorism, and so many people in our country choose to look the other way, so many people in our country choose to ignore it, so many people choose to be politically correct.”

At the federal level, like its membership base, ACT’s national conferences continued to swell in attendance and stature. In 2013, for example, one of the speakers at ACT’s conference was disgraced former FBI agent John Gundolo. Guandolo joined the FBI’s counterterrorism division in the wake of 9/11, but by 2005 he was posing as a driver for a “star witness” in the corruption case of former Congressman William Jefferson (D-LA). He made “inappropriate sexual advances” to that witness and soon was having an “intimate relationship…that he thought could damage an investigation,” according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune He also unsuccessfully solicited the witness for a $75,000 donation to an organization he supported and carried on extramarital affairs with female FBI agents.

Guandolo’s actions risked ruining the government’s prosecution of Jefferson, and he faced an investigation by the bureau's Office of Professional Responsibility. Though he later expressed “deep remorse” for his actions, he resigned from the bureau in December 2008 ahead of an internal. Later that month, he became a full-time counterterrorism expert often spreading anti-Muslim ideas and conspiracy theories.

According to his resume, that month Guandolo became Vice President of the Strategic Engagement Group, a  tiny consultancy advertised as the “only company in the United States aimed at identifying potential threats to homeland security.” He currently travels the country training law enforcement on counter-terror techniques and speaks at various events, including the 2013 Writers Workshop organized by the anti-immigrant  Social Contract Press, which regularly publishes white nationalist authors.

Guandolo’s presentation at ACT’s 2013 national conference unveiled one of ACT’s most disturbing endeavors to date: the Thin Blue Line project, billed as a “one-stop internet resource for information concerning the perceived threat of Muslim infiltration and terrorism in the country.” Its key component is a “Radicalization Map Locator,” listing the addresses of almost every Muslim Student Association (MSA) in the country as well as a number of mosques and Islamic institutions– all listed as suspected national security concerns. Just this year, Guandolo told a crowd in South Carolina that the sole purpose of MSA’s is to “recruit jihadis.”

At the federal level, ACT identifies national security bills which it deems “high priority legislation” and requests that its members encourage elected officials to support it. Some of the bills are introduced by legislators very sympathetic to the ACT cause, such as U.S. Reps. Steve King of Iowa and Trent Franks of Arizona.

ACT’s 2015 conference listed no fewer than fifteen elected federal officials as speakers, with part of the event taking place at the Capitol . Despite its hateful rhetoric towards Muslims, ACT’s efforts to build relationships with elected officials has been effective –– both on a federal and state level.   

In 2008, ACT began a campaign called Stop Shariah Now. According to the Stop Shariah Now website, the project aimed “to inform and educate the public about what Shariah is, how it is creeping into American society and compromising our constitutional freedom of speech, press, religion and equality what we can do to stop it.” In an interview with the Center for American Progress (CAP), then ACT staffer Chris Slick detailed how ACT worked closely with Frank Gaffney, head of the anti-Muslim think tank Center for Security Policy (CSP), to push anti-Shariah legislation at the state level.  

The anti-Shariah laws were drafted by CSP’s general counsel, David Yerushalmi, who equates Shariah with Islamic extremism and advocates criminalizing virtually any personal practice compliant with Shariah. In his view, only a Muslim who fully breaks with the customs of Shariah can be considered socially tolerable.

In early 2012, together with Robert Muise of the Thomas More Law Center, Yerushalmi formed the American Freedom Law Center (AFLC) and began pushing an “American Laws for American Courts” initiative to push a model anti-Shariah law, drafted primarily by Yerushalmi, in legislatures across the country. The bill argued that America has “unique values of liberty and freedom” that do not exist in foreign legal systems like Shariah law.

Legal experts call such anti-Shariah measures superfluous because there is no mechanism by which any foreign criminal or civil code can trump U.S. laws. By the summer of 2013, however, anti-foreign law measures had passed in Arizona, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Tennessee and North Carolina. The bills are still being introduced in states such as South Carolina in 2016.

The group has not only been active on a legislative level. In 2010, ACT targeted a Muslim professor serving on a human rights board in Florida, accusing him of having ties to radical Islamic groups and serving as a “mosque operative” in city government.

After months of opposition to Parvez Ahmed’s nomination to the Human Rights Commission of Jacksonville — he was appointed in 2010 — ACT held a news conference on the steps of Jacksonville City Hall to release a DVD containing highly edited clips of a speech Ahmed gave in October 2010, which the group claims shows “irrefutable” evidence of Ahmed’s associations with the Muslim Brotherhood and radical Islam — despite the absence of any footage speaking directly to that charge. The lack of evidence apparently didn’t trouble Randy McDaniels, the ACT chapter leader in Jacksonville who called the news conference. “It’s how he says what he says. What he doesn’t say. What’s inferred and the facts we know,” McDaniels said, adding that Ahmed was a “made man in the Muslim mafia.”

ACT’s campaign to discredit Ahmed went on for months. Activists claiming to be ACT members disrupted his public appearances, screaming that he belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood. Ahmed described being harassed at one public appearance to the point that audience members, fearing for his safety, escorted him from the room. Another eyewitness confirmed Ahmed’s account.

As ACT continued to develop a large grassroots base, it shifted focus to targeting public education. In 2012, ACT’s education arm released a lengthy report titled, “Education or Indoctrination? The Treatment of Islam in 6th through 12th Grade American Textbooks.” The report examined 38 textbooks for how Islam was depicted and concluded, “Perhaps the greatest disservice done to students is the net effect of the accumulation of these  errors –– the  creation  of  a  faulty  historical  narrative  that  not  only  misrepresents Islam  but  creates  an  inaccurate comparison between  Islam,  Christianity  and  Judaism, and  between  the  Muslim  world  and  the  West. Regardless  of  the  issue–slavery, conquest and imperialism, the Crusades, the Arab-Israeli conflict, to name a few–Islam30and the Muslim world are not generally held to the same rigor of historical analysis that the textbooks apply to Christianity, Judaism and the West.”

The report recommended that ACT activists take the textbook fight to their local school boards and many heeded the call. The founder of ACT’s Birmingham, Ala., chapter, Larry Houck, was ultimately unsuccessful in his attempts to remove 11 textbooks from state schools due to their alleged bias in favor of Islam. In January 2014, the Alabama school board voted 5-2 to approve the textbooks, much to the chagrin of Houck who wrote a letter to the board asking ""Why is so much text devoted to Islam?"" and claiming the books ""proselytize for Islam."" Despite its best efforts, the “Textbook Project” has been resoundingly unsuccessful.

ACT’s increasing popularity is due, in part, to Gabriel’s tactic of forging relationships with the American Christian right. Gabriel hired Guy Rodgers to serve as ACT’s executive director and this turned out to be a shrewd move. Rodgers brought with him a wealth of contacts from his time with the Christian Coalition, a group The New York Times has referred to to as “the most potent political organization on the Christian right.” The Coalition was created in 1989 by televangelist Pat Robertson, a rabid anti-gay activist who is also known for espousing conspiracy theories involving Jewish bankers and Freemasons.

Gabriel has a past relationship with Robertson, working as an anchor for one of his television programs when she resided in the Middle East. Rogers left ACT in 2014 and a year later the group claims 280,000 members and almost 900 chapters, spanning 11 countries.

In 2015, like many of the major anti-Muslim groups in the U.S., ACT began openly targeting Syrian refugees, launching a Refugee Resettlement Working Group that aims to make sure that, “potential terrorists are kept on the outside looking in” by attempting to stop Syrian refugee relocation in locales around the U.S.

ACT has a long history of targeting refugees. In 2011, ACT helped to pass anti-refugee legislation in Tennessee. Four years later, in email to supporters, ACT announced plans to take this effort to as many states of possible. “We are happy to announce that we will soon be working to see similar, enhanced, legislation of this nature introduced and passed in all 50 state legislatures,” an ACT alert announced. The anti-Muslim think tank Center for Security Policy is also working on this fight, but at the country rather than state level.

To boost its anti-refugee efforts, ACT also began cultivating a relationship with Ann Corcoran, the face of the anti-refugee movement in America and head of the website Refugee Resettlement Watch (RRW). Corcoran founded the blog in 2007 in response to what she saw as a “grievous error” by the government in taking in Muslim refugees.

Gabriel invited Corcoran to speak at ACT’s 2015 national conference where one of the main topics discussed was opposition to Syrian refugees. Before the conference, Gabriel wrote about how her organization is “thrilled” to have Corcoran speaking at the event. Gabriel herself has used her recent speaking engagements to attack draw the link between Syrian refugees and ISIS. In February of 2016, Montana ACT activists participated in an rally in opposition a proposal to open a refugee resettlement office in Missoula, Montana.

Alger Hiss (November 11, 1904 – November 15, 1996) was an American government official who was accused of being a Soviet spy in 1948 and convicted of perjury in connection with this charge in 1950. Before he was tried and convicted, he was involved in the establishment of the United Nations both as a U.S. State Department official and as a U.N. official. In later life he worked as a lecturer and author.

On August 3, 1948, Whittaker Chambers, a former U.S. Communist Party member, testified under subpoena before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) that Hiss had secretly been a Communist while in federal service. Called before HUAC, Hiss categorically denied the charge. When Chambers repeated his claim on nationwide radio, Hiss filed a defamation lawsuit against him.

During the pretrial discovery process, Chambers produced new evidence indicating that he and Hiss had been involved in espionage, which both men had previously denied under oath to HUAC. A federal grand jury indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury; Chambers admitted to the same offense but, as a cooperating government witness, was never charged. Although Hiss's indictment stemmed from the alleged espionage, he could not be tried for that crime because the statute of limitations had expired. After a mistrial due to a hung jury, Hiss was tried a second time. In January 1950, he was found guilty on both counts of perjury and received two concurrent five-year sentences, of which he eventually served three and a half years. Hiss maintained his innocence until his death.

Arguments about the case and the validity of the verdict took center stage in broader debates about the Cold War, McCarthyism, and the extent of Soviet espionage in the United States. Since Hiss's conviction, statements by involved parties and newly exposed evidence have added to the dispute. Author Anthony Summers argued that since many relevant files continue to be unavailable, the Hiss controversy will continue to be debated. In 2001, James Barron, a staff reporter for The New York Times, identified what he called a ""growing consensus that Hiss, indeed, had most likely been a Soviet agent.",,False,1068,1063,Subjects Matter: FBI Files,,0.00,2018-07-14 16:18:22.091295+00:00,2018-08-10,,alger-hiss-58202

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

EmmaBest,American Family Association (AFA),Completed,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/american-family-association-afa-31213/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning American Family Association (AFA). The American Family Association (AFA) says it promotes ""traditional moral values"" in media. A large part of that work involves ""combating the homosexual agenda"" through various means, including publicizing companies that have pro-gay policies and organizing boycotts against them. 

Initially founded as the National Federation for Decency, the American Family Association (AFA) originally focused on what it considered indecent television programming and pornography. The AFA says it promotes ""traditional moral values"" in media. A large part of that work involves ""combating the homosexual agenda"" through various means, including publicizing companies that have pro-gay policies and organizing boycotts against them. The AFA has a variety of outlets to disseminate its message, including the American Family Radio Network, its online One News Now and the monthly AFA Journal. In early 2011, the AFA claimed more than 2 million online supporters and 180,000 subscribers to its Journal.

Founded in 1977 by Methodist minister Donald E. Wildmon as the National Federation for Decency, the American Family Association (AFA) worked in its early years to remove what it considered indecent programming from television. Its other major focus was battling pornography. In 1988, the group's name was changed to the AFA, because the organization's concerns, Wildmon said in 2007, had expanded.

In 1985, Wildmon was appointed to former Attorney General Ed Meese's Commission on Pornography by its director, Alan Sears, who later would become president of the Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian-based legal organization. Wildmon successfully orchestrated the removal of Playboy and Penthouse from some 17,000 convenience stores. Also in the 1980s, Wildmon started ramping up the AFA's anti-LGBT propaganda and succeeded in getting some corporations to pull their ads from shows like ""Thirtysomething,"" which had been added to Wildmon's list of ""Trash TV"" because its plot included a gay romance.

Wildmon has never made a secret of his anti-LGBT views. One of his statements on the AFA's website reads, ""I never dreamed I would see the day when sodomy would be called normal, and those who held to traditional values based on Christian teaching would be called bigots."" According to the AFA, the primary goal of the ""homosexual movement"" is to ""abolish the traditional, Judeo-Christian view of human sexuality, marriage, and family.""

The AFA has been extremely vocal over the years in its opposition to LGBT rights, marriage equality and allowing gay men and lesbians to serve in the military. The group's arguments are filled with claims that equate homosexuality with pedophilia and argue that there's a ""homosexual agenda"" afoot that is set to bring about the downfall of American (and ultimately, Western) civilization. In one October 2004 article, the AFA Journal suggested that gay influences are leading to a ""grotesque culture"" that will include ""quick encounters in the middle school boys' restroom.""

For years, until 2010, the AFA had a section on its website that supposedly exposed ""The Homosexual Agenda."" There, a reader could find articles and other AFA publications that claimed LGBT people were trying to force the acceptance of homosexuality on children through sex education programs in schools; condemned companies like Disney for supporting LGBT rights and programming; and, also until 2010, featured a particularly noxious booklet the AFA had published in 1994. That booklet, Homosexuality in America: Exposing the Myths, included the bogus research of thoroughly discredited psychologist Paul Cameron as a source. One of the publication's authors, Richard Howe, used Cameron's ""research"" to claim that LGBT people don't live as long as heterosexuals, that they're more promiscuous and that the ""disgusting details of the homosexual lifestyle explain why so many diseases are present in the homosexual community."" Another claim was that ""[p]rominent homosexual leaders and publications have voiced support for pedophilia, incest, sadomasochism, and even bestiality.""

In 1998, in what would become a scandal for the group, the AFA signed on to a huge television and newspaper ""ex-gay"" campaign called ""Truth in Love,"" a project that advocated an idea popular in religious-right circles: that LGBT people can be ""cured"" so that they become heterosexual. A man named Michael Johnston was the star of the campaign. In one television ad shot with his mother present, Johnston discussed ""leaving homosexuality"" and was open about his HIV-positive status. Previously, Johnston had worked with Jerry Falwell as an ex-gay leader and done a ""Truth in Love"" commercial for Coral Ridge Ministries. He had also started his own ex-gay ministry, Kerusso, in 1989. Johnston was extremely active on the ex-gay circuit, and was the founder of ""Coming out of Homosexuality Day"" (which coincides with National Coming Out Day).

In 2000, Johnston's story was made available as a film by the AFA, titled ""It's Not Gay."" In the film, he is joined by other ex-gay activists who load the film with unsupported statistics, like ""80% of homosexual men have a sexually transmitted disease."" One of the other ex-gay activists in the film, Richard Cohen, has been discredited for his ""healing touch"" therapy, in which grown men are cradled and held like babies to get used to ""appropriate male touch"" and to ""re-create the father-son bond."" A broken father-son bond, Cohen claims, can ""cause"" homosexuality. In other ""therapy"" sessions, Cohen has clients beat pillows with tennis racquets while blaming their mothers for making them gay.

Three years later, in 2003, news outlets reported that Johnston, while traveling around the country decrying ""the homosexual lifestyle,"" was hosting orgies, taking drugs and having unprotected sex with other men without disclosing his HIV status. In the publicity and accusations that ensued, Johnston shut down his ministry and sought refuge at a live-in facility with Pure Life Ministries in Dry Ridge, Ky. As of 2011, Johnston was listed as Pure Life's director of donor and media relations. He states in his bio that in 2002 he ""was living a completely double life"" and is ""now walking in true freedom.""

The AFA, meanwhile, admitted that Johnston had ""relapsed."" In early 2007, Wayne Besen of ex-gay watchdog group Truth Wins Out, filed complaints with two attorneys general against the AFA and another anti-gay group, Americans for Truth About Homosexuality, for promoting and selling ""It's Not Gay,"" which Besen called ""deceptive."" The AFA addressed Besen's complaints in an article in its March 2007 AFA Journal. Buddy Smith, AFA executive assistant then, claimed that the AFA had stopped selling ""It's Not Gay"" as a result of the scandal. But in 2005, the AFA started selling the DVD again, after meeting with Johnston at Pure Life. Smith stated that the AFA felt confident then ""that Michael had been fully restored and was walking in victory."" The DVD is still available on the AFA's website, without any mention of the scandal. It is described as ""a fair and balanced approach to this challenging subject.""

The AFA's fundraising appeals are known for their shrillness. One mailer from the early 2000s read: ""For the sake of our children and society, we must OPPOSE the spread of homosexual activity! Just as we must oppose murder, stealing, and adultery!"" It continued, ""Since homosexuals cannot reproduce, the only way for them to ‘breed' is to RECRUIT! And who are their targets for recruitment? Children!"" In other appeals, the AFA has used a standard propaganda ploy against LGBT individuals: They're a danger to children.

In the summer of 2010, the AFA announced a boycott of Home Depot stores because Home Depot allegedly supports the ""homosexual agenda."" The AFA said that the home repair chain was ""deliberately exposing children to lascivious displays of sexual conduct by homosexuals"" through its support of pride parades.

The AFA has had very active state chapters, many of which have served as training grounds for anti-gay activists like Scott Lively, founder of the anti-gay hate group Abiding Truth Ministries. Lively, a former director of the AFA's California chapter, claimed in his discredited 1995 co-authored book The Pink Swastika that Germany's Nazi Party was full of gay men who were primarily responsible for the Holocaust. In 2007, Lively co-founded the virulent anti-gay group Watchmen on the Walls, which is particularly popular in Eastern European countries and among some Eastern European immigrants to the United States.

Gary Glenn, current president of the AFA's Michigan chapter, maintains a ""Homosexual Agenda"" link on the AFA-MI website. He has called anti-bullying legislation a way to indoctrinate children – and, by extension, American society – with ""the homosexual agenda"" (a common claim used by the anti-gay right). He has claimed that gay soldiers would cause disease in the military's ranks through ""battlefield blood transfusions"" and that gay soldiers are responsible for high rates of sexual assault in the military.

In 2009, the AFA hired Bryan Fischer, the former executive director of the AFA-affiliated Idaho Values Alliance, as its director of issue analysis for government and public policy and as a radio host. Taking a page from Lively's book, Fischer claimed on his radio show in May 2010 that Hitler chose homosexual soldiers as his elite officers because they were far more brutal and savage than heterosexual soldiers. In defense of that show, Fischer wrote that ""homosexuality gave us Adolph Hitler, and homosexuals in the military gave us the Brown Shirts, the Nazi war machine and six million dead Jews."" He also called for criminalizing gay sex in a February 2010 blog post – because doing so would ensure that ""controversies"" over ""gays in the military"" and ""gay indoctrination in the schools"" would end. He has also advocated forcing gay people into ex-gay therapy, which supposedly can ""cure"" their condition, because homosexuality should be treated in the same way as intravenous drug use. ""Both,"" he told radio host Alan Colmes, ""are equally dangerous and risky to human health."" By August 2010, the AFA had appended a disclaimer to Fischer's posts, stating that his opinions are his own.

That didn't stop Fischer's outrageous postings. In early 2011, Fischer called for an end to Muslim recruits in the U.S. military and an end to Muslim immigration to the U.S. At around the same time, he claimed that Native Americans remained mired in poverty because they refused to accept Christianity. The outcry over that blog post was so great that the AFA actually took it down. A week later, Fischer published a blog item stating that Native Americans should have followed Pocahontas' lead, because she had accepted ""the superior culture"" of the new arrivals to the New World.

Two months after the AFA removed Fischer’s post about Native Americans, he lambasted welfare programs, singling out African Americans for criticism by stating, “Welfare has destroyed the African-American family by telling young black women that husbands and fathers are unnecessary and obsolete. Welfare has subsidized illegitimacy by offering financial rewards to women who have more children out of wedlock. We have incentivized fornication rather than marriage, and it’s no wonder we are now awash in the disastrous social consequences of people who rut like rabbits.”

Once again, the AFA stepped in, but this time Fischer’s post was merely reworded, so that the last sentence of that paragraph now says “… and it’s no wonder we are now awash in the disastrous social consequences of those who engage in random and reckless promiscuity whether they are Caucasian, Hispanic, or African-American.”

In September 2012, however, Fischer said of African-American supporters of the Democratic Party: “They’re like drug-addled addicts and the Democrat Party has gotten them addicted to welfare benefits. That apparently is the only reason they continue to support this party.” And in August 2012, he claimed that if Obama were re-elected, the Department of Homeland Security was ready to use its ammunition against American citizens. He further warned that, “you’re going to hear some serious talk about secession in any number of places around America.”

Currently, the AFA is under the direction of Tim Wildmon, the son of Don Wildmon, who stepped down after 33 years, citing health problems. Tim Wildmon continues the group’s long tradition of anti-gay propagandizing and activism. Wildmon criticized Obama for including gay fathers in his 2010 Father’s Day proclamation, stating in a press release that it was the first time in history a president had used the day to “promote a radical homosexual agenda” and that he was putting the “twisted sexual desires of adults” ahead of children.

Earlier in 2012, Wildmon had notorious anti-gay pastor Patrick Wooden, along with the FRC’s Tony Perkins, on the AFA’s “Today’s Issues” segment of their American Family Radio (AFR). Both Perkins and Wildmon expressed admiration for Wooden, who is perhaps best known for claiming that gay men have to wear diapers or “butt plugs” because they lose control of their bowels. He has also called homosexuality “deviant,” “immoral,” and “anti-human.”

Buster Wilson, the general manager of AFR and host of the program “AFA Today,” suggested in 2012 that God might have sent Hurricane Isaac as punishment for a New Orleans LGBT festival and also tried to link the repeal of DADT to increased suicides, alcoholism, sexual assaults, and violence in the military. Wilson, a conspiracy theorist and member of the antigovernment “Patriot” group Oathkeepers, has also floated the idea that the Department of Homeland Security is buying millions of rounds of ammunition and possibly planning war against American civilians.

My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.",1363745-000,False,1636,1517,"Haters: Documenting Extremist and Hate Groups,Subjects Matter: FBI Files",,0.00,2016-12-23 05:00:00+00:00,2017-01-25,2017-04-21 00:00:00+00:00,american-family-association-afa-31213

EmmaBest,Aryan Brotherhood,Completed,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/aryan-brotherhood-31215/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning The Aryan Brotherhood, also known as The Brand, Alice Baker, AB or One-Two, which is the nation’s oldest major white supremacist prison gang and a national crime syndicate. Founded in 1964 by Irish bikers as a form of protection for white inmates in newly desegregated prisons, the AB is today the largest and deadliest prison gang in the United States, with an estimated 20,000 members inside prisons and on the streets.

Its motto is simple – “blood in, blood out.” AB chapters can be found in most major federal and state prisons in the country. As a crime syndicate, the AB participates in drug trafficking, male prostitution rings, gambling, and extortion inside prison walls. On the streets, the AB is involved in practically every kind of criminal enterprise, including murder-for-hire, armed robbery, gun running, methamphetamine manufacturing, heroin sales, counterfeiting and identity theft.

When officials began to desegregate state and federal prisons during the 1960s, black and white inmates were thrown up against each other in many cases for the first time, and violent conflicts resulted. The Aryan Brotherhood was formed at the San Quentin State Prison in California in 1964, organizing defensively against a violent black prison gang, the Black Guerilla Family, and becoming the first major white supremacist prison gang in the country in the process. Its original membership was largely Irish bikers who initially called themselves the Diamond Tooth Gang because members wore shards of glass in their teeth. But after merging with other white cliques in San Quentin, they renamed themselves the AB. Today, the gang operates both inside and outside prisons, and although it clearly has a white supremacist ideology, it is above all a criminal enterprise. Given the choice between making money and showing their racism, members virtually always go for the cash, meaning the gang has often worked with Latino and other gangs for profit.

Before joining the AB, potential recruits are required to “make their bones,” usually by attacking or murdering a rival gang member or assaulting a corrections officer (thus the “blood in” part of the gang’s motto; “blood out” indicates that once a person is part of the gang, the only way out is death). Inductees have been required to read Hitler’s Mein Kampf and, often, Sun Tzu’s The Art of War and Machiavelli’s The Prince. Many members practice Asatru, a neo-Pagan variant of pre-Christian Odinism that dates back to the Vikings and their Norse gods. Its adherents see themselves as ancient Viking warriors destined for Valhalla.

During the early 1970s, the California Department of Corrections noticed a startling increase in gang-related and racially motivated violence. Although the AB was not responsible for all of the reported deaths and assaults, it quickly earned a reputation for its “zero-tolerance” policy on “disrespect” from other inmates. At the same time, the AB signed on to a truce with another notorious racist prison gang, the Mexican Mafia (or “La Eme”), in that group’s battle with La Nuestra Familia, a Latino gang — early evidence that AB was more interested in profit than ideological purity.

By 1975, the Aryan Brotherhood had expanded into most California state prisons, where something of a race war was being waged. Within two years, moreover, as a number of high-ranking AB leaders were sent to federal prison, the group had seized the opportunity to begin to expand into the federal penitentiary system. As a result, the organization divided into the California AB and the federal system AB. “They’re like two related but different crime families,” said one former top AB leader. “They each have their [ruling] commission … but they’re allies.” At the same time, the group was growing. While there were fewer than 100 members in the late 1970s, hundreds more were recruited in following years, sometimes by swallowing whole racist skinhead gangs. Today, according to officials, there are a total of about 20,000 AB members, with large numbers present in both state and federal prisons.

In its early days, the Aryan Brotherhood employed a “one man, one vote” policy.  This changed in the early 1980s after it became clear this policy was causing chaos within the organization. Both the federal and state prison gang factions implemented a hierarchical structure similar to that of the military. A 12-man council was sworn in with a majority vote. A three-man commission oversaw the council. Michael Thompson served on the California council, while Barry “Barron” Mills, T.D. Bingham and John Greschner (before he quit the group in 1999 and began talking about it to investigators and others) oversaw the federal operation. Tightening the command structure made the gang more powerful and more dangerous.

On Oct. 22, 1983, AB member Tommy Silverstein stabbed corrections officer Merle E. Clutts to death in the Marion, Ohio, federal penitentiary with the help of another inmate. Hours after Clutts was murdered, another AB member, Clayton Fountain, stabbed corrections officer Robert Hoffman and assaulted two other officers because he did not want Silverstein to have a higher body count than him. At the time, the Marion facility was believed to be the most secure federal prison in the country. In response to the incident, federal prisons across the country began to move known AB members to “supermax” units or prisons around the country. These inmates were typically held in solitary confinement 23 hours a day and their contact with other inmates and outsiders was severely restricted. But even this did not stop the AB from carrying out its criminal activities. Several court cases have made clear that AB leaders are able to organize major criminal activities, including ordering people’s deaths, despite their isolation. In many cases, officials say, they do this through their wives or girlfriends, and in some they have been able to use their lawyers. In others, they are known to use highly sophisticated written codes and invisible inks. 

During the 1990s, the rapidly swelling AB increasingly favored organized criminal activity over promoting racism. That meant that the gang’s leaders recognized that drug trafficking in prison was a highly profitable enterprise and the gang began to sell drugs to African American and Latino inmates. According to imprisoned ex-AB “commissioner” John Greschner, who left the gang in 1999, race war ideology within the AB today is clearly secondary to its criminal activity. Greschner also has detailed how the gang instituted a sophisticated banking and collection system that included a 20% “tax” on the profits of any AB criminal enterprise on the streets. That money is laundered and controlled by the AB commissioners.

The AB’s criminal operations on the outside received a huge boost when Italian-American Mafia boss John Gotti was sentenced to life in prison without parole and transferred to the Marion facility in 1992. Gotti hired the AB to protect him, but went on to organize a business partnership between his associates and AB members on the outside. The move gave the AB unprecedented power on the streets, where the group had been operating in major cities since the 1980s, with an appointed leader in each city or, in the case of more sparsely populated areas, each region.

Gotti was not the gang’s first high-profile client. During the early 1970s, cult leader Charles Manson sought the AB’s protection. He was refused membership because he declined to kill other inmates because of their skin color. But the AB still used his coterie of female fans to smuggle drugs and weapons into San Quentin.

The AB is a notoriously deadly organization. Some years ago, authorities calculated that while the group’s members made up less than one tenth of 1% of the U.S. prison inmate population, they were responsible for 18% of all prison murders.

In recent years, authorities have been repeatedly frustrated by the way that imprisoned AB leaders have been able to organize and direct major criminal enterprises even from solitary confinement, where most are held. In 2002, they moved to indict 29 leaders of the federal AB organization, all of them held in various prisons around the country, for violations of federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations(RICO) Act. Twenty-one of the leaders were charged with death penalty offenses, even though many were already serving life terms, because prosecutors felt that was the only way they could stop their criminal activities. Among those charged with capital offenses were AB commissioners Mills and Bingham. But the tactic failed spectacularly when juries returned many convictions but no death penalties. The officials’ so-called “decapitation strike” had failed.

Members of the AB typically can be easily identified by their tattoos. Popular tattoos among AB members include a shamrock inscribed with the number 666, swastikas, the abbreviation A.B., and double lightning bolts, which stand for Hitler’s SS.

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:

Any and all documents and materials (such as files,reports,photographs,videos recordings,audio recordings ect..) be they electronic or otherwise regarding:

'Banca Nazionale del Lavoro' (BNL) whis has been a subsidiary of 'BNP Paribas' since 2006.

The bank was involved in a major political scandal (dubbed 'Iraq-gate' by the US media) when it was revealed in 1989 that the Atlanta, Georgia branch of the bank was making unauthorized loans of more than US $4.5 billion to Iraq. Many of the loans that the branch made were guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation program. The loans were originally intended to finance agricultural exports to Iraq, but were diverted by Iraq to buy weapons. The branch manager, Christopher P. Drogoul, indicated that the bank's headquarters office was aware of these loans, but senior bank official denied this. Drogoul pleaded guilty to three felony charges and served 33 months in federal prison.

The requested material will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the requested documents sent electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or sent via CD-ROM if not.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, the data management system (EDMS) and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant places,names,individuals,agencies and companies.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.","1368029, DOJ-AP-2019-002182",False,1584,735,Public Domain Programming: the Source Code of the Government,,0.00,2017-02-13 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-14,2019-06-12 13:28:10.440787+00:00,bank-robbers-app-dev-33284

MuckRock is a 501(c)(3), not-for-profit, educational organization, and, by definition, it has no commercial purpose. MuckRock exists to educate the public about the operations and activities of government, as well as to increase public understanding about the importance of ethics and the rule of law in government.

The particular records requested herein are sought as part of MuckRock's ongoing efforts to document the operations and activities of of government agencies and to educate the public about these operations and activities. Once MuckRock obtains the requested records, it intends to analyze them and disseminate the results of its analysis.

There is a clear public interest case in having these files released therefore I request fees be waived for the following reasons:

1) The questions raised about the government's motivations, integrity and judgment on this issue.

2) Any wrongdoing by the subject(s) in question, the government and/or other federal officials the materials may expose.

3) The subject is of ""widespread and exceptional media interest"" the widespread public interest and reporting on this case.

4) As a journalist and member of muckrock.com, I am engaged in reporting and disseminating information to the public, free of charge.",1396545,False,1222,790,,,0.00,2018-02-10 05:00:00+00:00,2018-03-13,2019-04-18 04:56:00+00:00,brotherhood-of-eternal-love-48578

It’s also the only KKK faction to establish chapters outside the U.S., with a sizable presence in Canada.

Where most present-day Klan groups splash pictures and news of their activities on their websites and online forums, the Brotherhood of Klans is exceptionally secretive, in the tradition of Klan groups of yesteryear, offering scant details of its actions online and conducting serious background checks of prospective members. In other ways, the BOK is quite modern. Its members often eschew white robes and hoods for paramilitary garb, and its leadership networks extensively with non-Klan white supremacists, most notably racist skinheads and outlaw bikers, as well as with other Klan outfits, especially those based in the Deep South.

The Brotherhood of Klans was founded in 1996 by Dale Fox, an old-school Southern Klansman who vowed to bring the Klan back to its original birthplace in Pulaski, Tenn. The closest Fox got to that goal was establishing a BOK chapter in Finger, Tenn., more than 100 miles west of Pulaski.

Even so, under Fox’s leadership, the Brotherhood of Klans rapidly became the biggest Ku Klux Klan organization in the United States. Fox’s power appeared to expand in 2002 when rival Klan leader Ron Edwards, who was then under intense law enforcement scrutiny, stepped down as imperial wizard, or national leader, of the Imperial Klans of America and appointed Fox to replace him. The following year, though, Edwards reclaimed his position atop the IKA. But when Fox left, he took a handful of IKA chapters with him.

Fox died of a heart attack in November 2006, while chopping down a tree on a fellow Klansman’s property. He was succeeded by Jeremy Parker, a former skinhead and former webmaster for the neo-Nazi Aryan Nations.

In 2007, Parker oversaw the Brotherhood of Klan’s expansion into Canada, establishing chapters in Regina, Saskatchewan, and Calgary, Alberta, which claim a combined membership of 250. Both Canadian chapters have participated in joint rallies and street demonstrations with the Aryan Guard, a violent neo-Nazi group based in Calgary.

My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.",1363699-000,False,1636,1532,"Haters: Documenting Extremist and Hate Groups,Subjects Matter: FBI Files",,0.00,2016-12-23 05:00:00+00:00,2017-01-25,2017-04-06 00:00:00+00:00,brotherhood-of-klans-31221

Fee Waiver Request:
1. The records requested will contribute to the understanding of the government's operations and activities. This is since it will reveal important details of the FBI's goals. This would be since the calendars would show the indirect interests of the FBI. The calendar would lead to understanding of the director's issues and solutions. Also, it would highlight and explain a timeline of what was happening. Lastly, it would show layers of the ""life as a director"". This would allow people to understand how and why the director, and indirectly the FBI, acted. Lastly, it would allow a clearer picture to the scandals and prove or disprove them.
2. There are many ways how the public would want this. I would like to point that everyone has been intrigued in what Comey has done. Also, since 2016 there has been an uproar in wanting to know what the FBI has done and will do.
3. This will allow the public to have more understanding. This is since the public has had slight "" shades of light"". This information will show the scope of Wray and Comey. Ultimately, it will allow the public to be submerged in full light. This has been shown through CNN, FOX, etc. Finally, it will show some details that might otherwise not be known.

Expedited Processing:
The public would like to know what was going on in the FBI day by day. It will show many things that will prove or disprove, and might cause more wanting. Per your knowledge of the public's interest, I request expedited processing. Also, Muckrock is a website that will deliver this information.

Founded in 1988 by former Reagan administration official Frank Gaffney, Jr., The Center for Security Policy (CSP) has gone from a respected hawkish think tank focused on foreign affairs to a conspiracy-oriented mouthpiece for the growing anti-Muslim movement in the United States.

Known for its accusations that a shadowy “Muslim Brotherhood” has infiltrated all levels of government and warnings that “creeping Shariah,” or Islamic religious law, is a threat to American democracy, CSP’s Gaffney has called for Congressional hearings along the lines of the notorious Cold War-era House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) to expose Muslim conspiracies. CSP has even been banned from the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a premier gathering of thousands of conservatives each spring in Washington, D.C.

Frank Gaffney, Jr. founded the neo-conservative turned anti-Muslim think tank Center for Security Policy (CSP) in 1988, following his tenure as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Nuclear Forces and Arms Control Policy in the Ronald Reagan administration.

From the late 80’s to the mid-2000’s, CSP was seen as a mainstream though hawkish organization that favored the so-called “peace through strength” doctrine popularized by President Reagan. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the CSP never left its Cold War mentality, and instead shifted its focus from battling Communism to fighting Islam.

Along those lines, CSP supported the so called “War on Terror” and in 2002, a prominent British newspaper listed Frank Gaffney with Iraq invasion cheerleaders Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, and Richard Perle as one of the men “directing” then-President George W. Bush’s post 9/11 security doctrine.

For the past decade, CSP’s main focus has been on demonizing Islam and Muslims under the guise of national security. Statements from Frank Gaffney and other CSP staffers, along with claims made in CSP publications, have become increasingly conspiratorial in nature, making such claims as Muslims are attempting to overthrow the US government from within, and that Shariah law is trumping the constitution in American courts.

In the late 2000’s the anti-Muslim movement in America became more organized, and CSP quickly established itself as one of the movement’s premier think tanks. Many of the other organizations making up this movement, such as the grassroots group ACT! for America, were young, but CSP enjoyed extensive contacts in Washington after almost 20 years working in the capital. Gaffney and CSP thus became a key player in the anti-Muslim movement almost overnight.

In 2010, CSP teamed up with some of America’s most notorious anti-Muslim activists, who Gaffney referred to as “Team B II,” to produce a report titled “Shariah: The Treat To America.” The name “Team B II” is a nod to the original “Team B,” a group of conservative analysts commissioned by the CIA in 1976 to evaluate classified information on the threat the Soviet Union posed. That evaluation has been declassified, and determined to be mostly inaccurate, having grossly exaggerated the threat the Soviet Union then posed to the United States. A Senate investigative committee found in 1978 that the members of the original Team B had “yielded a flawed composition of political views and biases.”

Nevertheless, the CSP-produced report focused on what it called the “preeminent totalitarian threat of our time: the legal-political-military doctrine known within Islam as shariah [sic].” The report is a 170-page compendium of conspiracy theories and anti-Islamic claims, including the notion that “many of the most prominent Muslim organizations in America are front groups for the Muslim Brotherhood,” which, the report claims, is trying to implement Shariah law across the U.S. and around the world.

The report concluded with a number of alarmist recommendations, including a call for U.S. government agencies to halt outreach to Muslim communities “through Muslim Brotherhood fronts whose mission it is to destroy our country from within, as such practices are both reckless and counterproductive.” Other recommendations included warning Imams that they will be charged with sedition if they advocate for Shariah in America. The report also called for dismantling so-called “no-go zones”—non-existent neighborhoods where law enforcement are rumored to be unable to police because they’re heavily Muslim. The report’s authors admit that, “such measures will, of course, be controversial in some quarters.”

CSP recruited several people to contribute to the report, including Tom Trento, founder of the anti-Islam group The United West (Florida Security Council), who has a record of peddling anti-Islam conspiracy theories. Trento once addressed a crowd in Florida in December 2015 after the Broward County Sheriff hired a Muslim deputy, saying, “What the hell is going on that Scott Israel [the sheriff] hires a terrorist!” Diana West was another contributor. An author and columnist, West has said that it is really the basic teachings of Islam, not “some peculiar strain called ‘Islamism’ or of an organization such as the Muslim Brotherhood or ISIS,” that poses a threat to Americans’ constitutional liberties.  

Also a member of “Team B II” was Lt. General Jerry Boykin, a retired three-star general. In 2010, the same year the Team B II report was released, Boykin appeared on a video of the Christian Dominionist-leaning Oak Initiative stating, “[Islam] should not be protected under the First Amendment, particularly given that those following the dictates of the Quran are under an obligation to destroy our Constitution and replace it with sharia law.” He has also referred to Islam as “evil.” Boykin is currently the executive vice president of the Family Research Council (FRC), an anti-LGBT hate group.

Another Team B II contributor was John Guandolo, a disgraced former FBI agent. Guandolo joined the FBI’s counterterrorism division in the wake of 9/11, but by 2005 he was posing as a driver for a “star witness” in the corruption case of former Congressman William Jefferson (D-LA). He made “inappropriate sexual advances” to that witness and soon was having an “intimate relationship…that he thought could damage an investigation.” He also unsuccessfully solicited the witness for a $75,000 donation to an organization he supported and carried on extramarital affairs with female FBI agents.

Guandolo’s actions risked ruining the government’s prosecution of Jefferson, and he faced an investigation by the bureau's Office of Professional Responsibility. Though he later expressed “deep remorse” for his actions, he resigned from the bureau in December, 2008, ahead of an internal review. Not long after, he became a full-time anti-Muslim activist and conspiracy theorist—all under the guise of being a counterterrorism expert. According to his resume, Guandolo became Vice President of the Strategic Engagement Group the same month he resigned from the FBI. He describes the tiny consultancy as the “only company in the United States aimed at identifying potential threats to homeland security.” He currently travels the country training law enforcement on counter-terror techniques and speaks at various events. In 2013 he made an appearance at an event hosted by the anti-immigrant Social Contract Press, a group that regularly publishes white nationalist authors.

Two other members of CSP’s Team B II report are current CSP staffers, namely Clare Lopez, a former CSP fellow and current vice president for research and analysis, and David Yerushalmi, Esq., CSP’s general counsel. Lopez spent two decades at the CIA before joining up with Gaffney. Her history of touting anti-Muslim conspiracy theories echoes those of CSP. She has long claimed, for example, that the Muslim Brotherhood has “infiltrated and suborned the U.S. government to actively assist … the mission of its grand jihad.” She wrote a 2013 report that linked Huma Abedin, deputy chief of staff to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, to the Muslim Brotherhood — a favorite, but false, allegation on the far right that earned condemnation from conservative members of Congress like Senator John McCain (R-AZ).

Yerushalmi is the architect of the “anti-Shariah” bills that appeared in dozens of states in recent years. Yerushalmi began his campaign in 2006 by founding the Society of Americans for National Existence (SANE), an anti-Muslim organization devoted to promoting his theory that Islam is inherently seditious and that Shariah, is a “criminal conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government.” He equates Shariah with Islamic extremism so totally that he advocates criminalizing virtually any personal practice compliant with Shariah. In his view, only a Muslim who fully breaks with the customs of Shariah can be considered socially tolerable.

In early 2012, Yerulshalmi founded the American Freedom Law Center (AFLC) along with fellow attorney Robert Muise of the Thomas More Law Center, a Christian Right law firm. Arguing that America has “unique values of liberty and freedom” that do not exist in foreign legal system,  the AFLC has launched an “American Laws for American Courts” initiative to push model anti-Shariah legislation, drafted primarily by Yerushalmi, in state houses across the country,. Legal experts accurately describe such anti-Shariah measures as superfluous given that there is no mechanism by which any foreign criminal or civil code can trump U.S. laws. By the summer of 2013, however, anti-foreign law measures had passed in Arizona, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Tennessee and North Carolina. Similar bills are being introduced in states in 2016.

A year after CSP published the Team B II report, Gaffney’s anti-Muslim conspiracy theories began to draw the ire of not only the left, but also the right. In January 2011, Gaffney penned a piece for the conspiracy-orientated website World Net Daily where he claimed that two board members of the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC) were secretly aiding the Muslim Brotherhood. Gaffney’s evidence for such an accusation was that board member and anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist’s wife is Palestinian-American, while board member Suhail Khan is Muslim. Both were political appointees in the George W. Bush administration with long experience in conservative Republican Party affairs.

CPAC chairman David Keene responded to these claims by banning Gaffney and CSP from participating at the event, noting that Gaffney ""has become personally and tiresomely obsessed with his weird belief that anyone who doesn't agree with him on everything all the time or treat him with the respect and deference he believes is his due, must be either ignorant of the dangers we face or, in extreme case, dupes of the nation's enemies.""

The CSP serves to propagate Gaffney’s claims, often by issuing alarming “investigative” reports and other products, like the 10-part video course hosted by Gaffney titled “The Muslim Brotherhood in America,” and to further a conspiratorial outlook of Muslim Americans: “America faces in addition to the threat of violent jihad another, even more toxic danger — a stealthy and pre-violent form of warfare aimed at destroying our constitutional form of democratic government and free society. The Muslim Brotherhood is the prime-mover behind this seditious campaign, which it calls ‘civilization jihad’.” 

In keeping with its Cold War traditions, CSP issued another dubious report, titled, “Rise of the ‘Iran Lobby’: Tehran’s front groups move on– and into– the Obama Administration” in 2009. The report alleged that an “Iran Lobby” is operating in Washington, D.C., and influencing U.S. policy through a network of shady operatives and prominent politicos. The report said that “in one way or another” then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass, and Dennis Ross, then the special advisor for the Persian Gulf and Southwest Asia to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were among those with ties to the Iran Lobby.

As the anti-Muslim movement began to increase in size and influence, CSP also branched out to potential allies in the anti-immigrant movement. Gaffney for example, is an admirer and ally of Mark Krikorian, head of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) which essentially plays the same role in anti-immigrant circles as does CSP in the anti-Muslim movement – namely, providing reports with dubious claims and conspiracy theories that grassroots groups and others can use as “proof” to support anti-immigrant claims.

In the winter of 2012 CIS hosted Gaffney at the Women’s National Republican Club in Manhattan to discuss the topic ""Immigration as a Catalyst for Shariah in the West?"" Gaffney’s opening remarks were telling, in that he admitted that he wanted to help further bridge the gap between the already-converging anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant movements in the United States.

“In truth,” Gaffney said, “I’m sure you’re here for the Center for Immigration Studies, at least I hope you are, because I’m here for the Center for Immigration Studies because I have had a chance to work with Mark and his team a lot.” He went on to say that, “one of the things I hope we might talk about in the course of the conversation is what we might do much more of because I see a nexus developing between the work that Mark really does uniquely in this country and the work that we do, and it would be terrific if we could collaborate more intensively.”

In truth, CSP has organized with anti-immigrant groups for over a decade. In 2005, for example, Gaffney spoke at an event co-sponsored by the anti-immigrant hate group Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). FAIR and CIS account for two of the “big three” anti-immigrant groups in the U.S., and CSP is also allied with the third, NumbersUSA , the anti-immigrant movement’s grassroots mobilizer. Rosemary Jenks, NumbersUSA’s vice president and director of government relations, is a stalwart at CSP events.

In 2013, the inflammatory right-wing site Breitbart News hosted “Uninvited,” a series of panels in the same hotel as CPAC 2013. Those panels featured a number of anti-Muslim commentators and activists, including Pamela Geller, Robert Spencer and Gaffney. Kicking off that event was Rep. Steve King (R-IA), a supporter of the anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim movements who has suggested that the U.S. government should spy on mosques and attempted to paint two Muslim congressmen as un-American by not “renouncing Shariah law.” King also said in early 2015 that undocumented immigrants given a path to citizenship will “destroy our republic.”

Breitbart organized a larger conference in 2014 titled “The Uninvited II: National Security Action Summit,” which was moderated by Gaffney. It took place at a hotel down the street from the 2014 CPAC conference in Washington, D.C. The summit featured anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant speakers as well as politicians, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), speaking on panels with titles like, “Amnesty and Open Borders: The End of America – and the GOP,” and “Benghazigate: The Ugly Truth and the Cover-up,” part of the right-wing’s continued attempt to use the tragic events in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 to hurt the Obama administration and Secretary of Clinton. An investigation into the attacks on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi led by the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee found no wrongdoing by Obama administration officials.

CSP held its annual awards ceremony in 2015 at the posh Metropolitan Club of New York City. The packed fundraiser honored Congressman Trent Franks (R-AZ), a champion for the anti-Muslim cause, as well as Beth Van Duyne, the mayor of Irving, Texas. The mayor made national headlines in February 2015 when she began vocally opposing a tribunal dealing with civil cases between Muslim couples, in which an Imam was acting as the arbitrator. Van Duyne and CSP saw this as proof of their claims that Shariah law was being implemented in the US, even though similar religious tribunals have existed for decades in the American Jewish and American Christian communities to resolve disputes, something the Islamic Center of Irving duly noted in its response to the mayor.

In September, a few months after Van Duyne received CSP’s 2015 “Defender of Freedom” award, police in Irving arrested a 14-year-old Muslim student on suspicion that he had brought a bomb to his school. The “bomb” turned out to be a homemade clock. Not long after Ahmed Mohamed’s wrongful arrest, CSP’s Clare Lopez told the crowd on a panel at the Christian Right Values Voter Summit in Washington D.C. that she had just gotten back from Irving where she and John Guandolo had been training law enforcement.

The bulk of CSP’s efforts in 2015 were devoted to creating a climate a fear around Syrian refugees entering the United States. Thousands of Syrian refugees fled their war-torn homeland in 2015 for European countries and the U.S., which has created an anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim backlash in this country and Europe. CSP put out a survey asking to “collect contact and geographical data from those who wish to stay engaged” in “refugee resettlement action” – meaning working to prevent the relocation of refuges to a certain locations.

CSP has also taken Ann Corcoran, the face of the anti-refugee movement in America, under its wing. Corcoran also promotes “refugee resettlement action” which she calls “pockets of resistance” to refugee resettlement. In April 2015, Corcoran released “Refugee Resettlement and the Hijra to America,"" a pamphlet published by the CSP which included calls for Americans to oppose the opening of mosques in their neighborhoods and a ban on all Muslim immigration to the United States. Corcoran also spoke at two of CSP’s major events in 2015. CSP continues to work on creating model legislation at the county level that would ban all Syrian refugee relocation to counties that enacted it.

CSP’s campaign against Syrian refugees prompted its founder to seek out more radical allies. In September 2015, Gaffney invited white nationalist Jared Taylor on his radio show to discuss the Syrian refugee crisis. Taylor is considered a preeminent spokesman for the white nationalist movement in America.

During the interview, Gaffney called Taylor's white nationalist American Renaissance website ""wonderful,"" and asked, “Is it the death of Europe what we’re seeing at the moment in terms of this migration, this invasion?” After a number of watchdog groups including the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote about Taylor’s appearance on the radio show, Gaffney backtracked, and attempted to bury the evidence by scrubbing the Taylor interview from his site and claiming he was “unfamiliar” with Taylor’s views before inviting him on.

With an eye on the 2016 election, CSP organized and held four National Security Action Summits in 2015 in early election states including Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. A number of the GOP candidates joined the cast of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant characters at these Summits, including Ben Carson, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. 

Gaffney again teamed up with Cruz and Trump following the announcement of the Iran nuclear deal. Trump and Cruz held an anti-Iran rally in Washington, D.C. on September 9, 2015, which was co-sponsored by CSP. Brigitte Gabriel, head of the largest grassroots anti-Muslim group in the country, ACT! for America, also spoke. 

On December 7, 2015, GOP candidate Donald Trump issued a press release calling to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Trump’s campaign cited a bogus CSP poll released a few months earlier in June claiming ""25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad"" and that 51 percent of those polled ""agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah."" Trump praised the staff of CSP, stating they are ""very highly respected people, who I know, actually.”

When the poll was first released , the Bridge Initiative at Georgetown University, a project started to connect the academic study of Islamophobia with the public square, debunked it immediately, noting that, “CSP’s survey was a non-probability based, opt-in online survey, administered by the conservative group, the Polling Company/Woman Trend, a small Washington-based agency that has collaborated with CSP on other occasions to produce surveys about Islam and Muslims.” In parentheses, the Bridge Initiative stated, “We learned this after reaching out to the Polling Company to get more details about their methodology, which wasn’t released to the public when Gaffney began promoting the survey’s findings.” According to the body that sets ethical standards for polling, the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), opt-in surveys cannot be considered representative of the intended population, in this case Muslims.”

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

Hansen was best known for compiling and publishing information regarding nuclear weapons. Published accounts suggest Hansen was interviewed by the FBI around 1993 in connection with a FOIA request he filed, see https://fas.org/sgp/bulletin/sec32.html .

In addition to all other searches you would customarily conduct, please conduct cross-referenced, ELSUR, relevant field office (including but not limited to San Francisco Field office, and any relevant subcomponents such as the Palo Alto or San Jose resident agencies if relevant records may be stored at those locations), and ARC (and any other such facility/system of old records) searches using electronic and manual indices as appropriate.

This request is not being made for commercial purposes. The requested records will be immediately and freely available to the public on muckrock.com.

I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by portal upload or e-mail attachment if available, or CD-ROM if not. 


Thanks for your help!

Once one of the largest and most active Klan groups in America, the Church of the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan has more recently gained a kind of ""Keystone Kops"" reputation on the white supremacist scene for its bumbling ways.

The National Knights of the Klu Klux Klan formed in 1960 as a response to the growing civil rights movement. Originally a collection of splintered Klan groups from several southern states, this loose confederation quickly grew into one of the largest Klan groups in the nation. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the National Knights coordinated a series of cross burnings across the South (reportedly more than 1,000) on March 26, 1960, and claimed between 10,000 and 15,000 members.

From 1963 until his death in 1993, James R. Venable served as the imperial wizard, or national leader, of the National Knights. A Georgia lawyer whose ancestors owned the legendary Stone Mountain near Atlanta — the site of the 1915 rally that inaugurated the so-called ""second era"" Klan — Venable used the mountaintop and nearby family land for annual rallies that drew members from the National Knights but also other Klan factions. In 1993, the year he died, Venable appointed Railton Loy, a former railroad worker who goes by the Klan name Ray Larsen, to take over as the next imperial wizard. Under Loy's leadership, the National Knights continued to hold rallies at the group's new headquarters outside of South Bend, Ind. But unlike in the past, attendance at these events was sparse. Just 35 supporters showed up for a May 5, 2001, rally, for instance, while over 200 people attended a nearby counter-protest, according to the South Bend Tribune. 

Even worse than the low turnouts, these events often proved embarrassing for National Knights, leading to tangles with the law. After the 2001 rally was over, as police escorted the Klan members to their cars and away from the counter-protesters, Klansmen could not remember where they parked. In the confusion, a fight with counter-protesters began that resulted in eight arrests, including that of Loy's son, Grand Dragon (or state leader) Richard Loy. It didn't stop there. Local newspaper coverage of the rally used the elder Loy's real name instead of his preferred alias, Ray Larsen. After Loy allegedly called a reporter, demanding that she use his alias and asking where she lived, he was charged with misdemeanor telephone harassment. Then, the next month, two sheriff's deputies in Williamson County, Texas, were fired after they tried to recruit a fellow officer with an application touting ""White Supremacy."" Dept. David Gay, 44, and Sgt. Greg Palm, 29, had both worked for the sheriff's office for more than four years. 

The National Knights really lived up to their ""Keystone Kops"" reputation when Railton and Richard Loy hosted what was widely billed as a ""Christmas unity rally"" on Dec. 8, 2002, at the younger Loy's Osceola, Ind., farm. They hoped to bring together various factions of the contentious world of professional racists, and indeed, they drew members of two far larger groups — the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the Aryan Nations, which sent its then-propaganda chief, August Kreis. Close to 50 people gathered for the Saturday afternoon dinner and cross burning. As hungry racists filed into the shed where food was being served, it quickly became apparent that the Loys had forgotten a critical fact: Large numbers of Klansmen are followers of Christian Identity, a racist and anti-Semitic theology that holds that Jews are biologically Satanic and whites are the true Israelites — meaning, according to Identity adherents' reading of the Bible, that whites can't eat pork. When guest Klansmen strolled into the shed and were confronted by a dead pig that by all accounts was barely cooked, several Klansmen and Aryan Nations members recoiled with horror. 

The situation became even more ridiculous. As the gathered haters circulated and clucked about the culinary faux pas — and while a red-suited ""Klanta Klaus"" worked the crowd nearby — some got to wondering why Rick Loy had a badly swollen lip and two missing front teeth. Soon enough, the story came out, provoking a fresh round of mirth. After being presented with a riot shield that was alleged to be bulletproof, Loy had apparently decided to put the matter to a test, firing a round into the shield at close range. Unsurprisingly, the bullet ricocheted off the shield — which stood up to the tryout admirably — and hit Loy in the mouth. 

Things got worse still. As the climactic moment of the afternoon arrived, Klansmen struggled to set up a giant swastika to burn. It collapsed on the ground. Finally, the Nazi symbol was burned where it lay. Then it was time for the cross. It quickly became apparent that it wasn't going to be possible to get the cross upright for burning — at least not the way it had been constructed. In the end, someone had the bright idea of sawing about 12 feet off the wooden cross' bottom, after which it, too, was finally lit. Not long afterward, the rally then came to an end, and its embarrassed participants headed for home. 

Despite its sometimes comical stumbles, the National Knights remains a potentially violent and dangerous group. This fact became obvious on Jan. 1, 2003, when Glen Gautier, a member of the National Knights, confessed to authorities his role in the brutal murder of another Klan member. By his own account, Gautier, who was 50 at the time, had carried out the killing with three other members of two separate but allied Klan chapters, or ""klaverns,"" that roamed the backwoods of semi-rural central North Carolina in 2001, stealing guns, making bombs, plotting murders, and carrying out at least one. His confession triggered parallel state murder and federal gunrunning cases, which have since dragged on for years. In the end, two members of the National Knights pleaded guilty in 2006 to charges in connection with a plot to blow up the Johnston County, N.C., courthouse and kill Sheriff Steve Bizzell, and were sentenced to a year in federal prison after cooperating with authorities. Two months later, in December, a judge found Klan boss and alleged ringleader Charles Barefoot incompetent to stand trial for orchestrating the murder of a fellow Klansman suspected of informing to police.

After serving in Korea and Japan as an enlisted man in Army Intelligence, George was one of the CIA’s earliest recruits. As such George challenged the traditional image of early CIA recruits. He was not a son of privilege and lacked an Ivy League pedigree. By many accounts, he developed a loyal following for his ebullient manner and courage working in some of the world’s most volatile regions.

After a highly decorated career lasting nearly thirty years, including dangerous assignments in Beirut and Athens, George served for three years in the Reagan Administration as Deputy Director for Operations. He was the third-ranking official at the CIA under William Casey.
George made headlines when he became the highest-ranking target of investigation and prosecution in the Iran–Contra affair.

In his May 9 termination letter to Director Comey, President Trump stated, “While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.” https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3711113/Comey-White-House-DOJ-DAG.pdf

In a May 11 interview with NBC News's Lester Holt, President Trump expanded on this claim, asserting that the three occasions involved one dinner at the White House and two phone calls. http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/11/politics/transcript-donald-trump-nbc-news/ 

If the president’s account is true, then he has confirmed this information in a public venue and any related documents should not be treated as confidential.

The New York Times detailed the only time they could confirm that Director Comey and President Trump shared a meal was on January 27, 2017. It is unclear when, precisely, the phone calls may have happened. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/politics/trump-comey-firing.html 

Fee Waiver Request

I respectfully request that you waive all fees in connection with this request as provided by 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 40 C.F.R. § 2.107(l). The Sierra Club is a national environmental nonprofit with no commercial interest in obtaining the requested information. Instead, our organization intends to analyze and disseminate the requested information free of charge so that the public can be better informed and meaningfully participate in government oversight.

As explained below, this FOIA request satisfies the factors listed in the Justice Department's governing regulations for waiver or reduction of fees – as well as the requirements of fee waiver under the FOIA statute – that “disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), see also 40 C.F.R. § 2.107(l).

The subject matter of the requested records is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government by settling the disputed issue that Director Comey disclosed to President Trump that the FBI was not investigating the president. 

Detailing the status of a criminal investigation to an associated individual is against agency protocol. In the New York Times article mentioned above and a follow-up NBC News story, multiple anonymous sources close to former Director Comey disputed the president’s claims. http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/my-dinner-comey-current-former-fbi-officials-dispute-trump-account-n758221 

The individuals, including current and former FBI officials, told the news outlets that Director Comey never would have told the president he was not under investigation, that Director Comey did not ask to keep his job during the conversation, and that Director Comey did not request the dinner. White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in turn, denied the sources’ claims that the president asked Director Comey for a pledge of loyalty.

Several of these disputes are clearly in the public interest, as evidenced by the large amount of news coverage as well as the strong concerns expressed by members of Congress and legal and ethics experts. Additionally, information related to these conversations would help shed a light on why the director of the FBI was abruptly fired without a clear successor having been identified. Clarification on these matters is needed to protect the integrity of an independent FBI.

The Sierra Club and its supporters have demonstrated interest and expertise in the subject area, specifically the development of policies designed to safeguard our democracy, enforce the rule of law, and ensure government transparency. The Sierra Club maintains an active Democracy program and weighs in when nominations and legislation affect that work. In recent months, tens of thousands of our supporters have sent letters to government officials regarding the “Trump-Russia” investigation. 

Media Requester Status

The Sierra Club has the ability and intention to disseminate the information it receives through this request. The information may be shared through emails to an audience reaching into the millions, Facebook and Twitter posts reaching tens of thousands of followers, articles on our often-visited website, and analysis provided to the media.

My professional duties at the Sierra Club include composing mass communications to our followers, analyzing FOIA responses, and coordinating with press secretaries. Here are three such examples that resulted from my work:

https://sierraclub.org/planet/2017/04/hiring-freeze-prevented-epa-filling-hundreds-jobs 
http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/13/politics/epa-hiring-freeze/index.html 
http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/press-releases/4480/over-700000-people-tell-government-to-block-seed-mergers 

The bulk of my work entails planning and writing content about public policy and distributing it through email, webpages, and social media. 

I ask that, in addition to being granted a public interest fee waiver, I be properly categorized as a representative of the news media, as the information I have presented shows that I meet the definition expressed in 28 CFR § 16.10(b)(6): “any person or entity that actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. 

Expedited Treatment

Due to the exceptional circumstances surrounding the Trump-Russia investigations and the FBI director's ouster, I request expedited treatment of this FOIA request, which meets two of the Department of Justice’s possible rationales for granting expedited processing.
 
28 C.F.R. § 16.5(e)(1)(iv) provides for expedited processing when there is a ""matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence."" 

President Trump himself alluded to the lack of public confidence in the government’s investigations in his May 9 termination letter: “It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.” This is juxtaposed against a number of news articles and prominent individuals that question the president’s rationale for firing Director Comey, dispute his recollection of the content of their conversations, and express concerns over the integrity of the FBI’s future investigations.

In addition to the articles mentioned in the Background Information and Fee Waiver Request sections, one may find a large amount of news covering the disputed content of the Trump-Comey conversations. Here are a few additional examples:

http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-comey-holt-20170511-story.html
http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/president-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey-article-1.3150918 
http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/05/donald-trump-firing-james-comey-investigation-fbi-russia 
http://www.npr.org/2017/05/11/527950704/trump-says-he-called-comey-and-asked-if-he-was-under-investigation

28 C.F.R. § 16.5 (e)(1)(ii) provides the other relevant rationale for an expedited processing determination: ""An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information."" 

As described in the Media Requester Status section, my primary professional activity is information dissemination. This request meets the three primary factors in determining whether there is an urgency to inform:

1. The request concerns a matter of current exigency to the American public, given the central roles the involved officials play in the Trump-Russia investigation and the possibility that top administration officials are using their positions to influence it. Furthermore, the president is likely to nominate a replacement FBI director in the coming days ahead; U.S. senators and citizens should have these documents available at that time to provide context during the confirmation process.
2. The consequences of delaying a response would compromise a significant recognized interest. Delaying this information through the normal FOIA process would represent a clear loss in value to the developing breaking news story and could impact the ability of the FBI to reliably conduct its investigation in an independent manner. 
3. The request concerns federal government activity: conversations that occurred between the White House and the FBI pertaining to work that FBI agents are conducting.

The information contained in this request is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Exempt Records

Should you decide to invoke a FOIA exemption with regard to any of the requested records, please include in your response letter sufficient information for an appeal, including:

1. Basic factual material about each withheld item, including the originator, date, length, general subject matter, and location of each item.
2. Explanations and justifications for denial, including the identification of the category within the governing statutory provision under which the document (or portion thereof) was withheld and a full explanation of how each exemption fits the withheld material.

If you determine that portions of a requested record are exempt from disclosure, please redact the exempt portions and provide the remainder of the record.

Record Delivery

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. In the event that there are fees, please inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. 

Please produce the records on a rolling basis; at no point should the search for – or deliberation concerning – certain records delay the production of others that the agency has already retrieved and elected to produce.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your timely response.

Sincerely,

Alexander Rony

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. My primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

The Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC) is the modern reincarnation of the old White Citizens Councils, which were formed in the 1950s and 1960s to battle school desegregation in the South. Created in 1985 from the mailing lists of its predecessor organization, the CCC has evolved into a crudely white supremacist group.

Among other things, its Statement of Principles says that it “oppose[s] all efforts to mix the races of mankind.” Created in 1985 from the mailing lists of its predecessor organization, the CCC, which initially tried to project a ""mainstream"" image, has evolved into a crudely white supremacist group whose website has run pictures comparing the late pop singer Michael Jackson to an ape and referred to black people as ""a retrograde species of humanity."" The group's newspaper, Citizens Informer, regularly publishes articles condemning ""race mixing,"" decrying the evils of illegal immigration, and lamenting the decline of white, European civilization. Gordon Baum, the group’s founder, died in March of 2015.

Founded in 1985 by Gordon Baum, a worker's compensation attorney and longtime racist activist, the Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC) rose from the ashes of the Citizens Councils of America (CCA), commonly called ""White Citizens Councils,"" a coalition of white-supremacist groups and individuals formed throughout the South to defend school segregation after the Supreme Court outlawed the policy in 1954 in Brown vs. Board of Education. 

Unlike the KKK, the CCA groups had a veneer of civic respectability, inspiring future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall to refer to it as the ""uptown Klan."" While there were plenty of bare-knuckle racists attracted to the councils' anti-integration slogan, ""Never!,"" the members also included bankers, merchants, judges, newspaper editors and politicians — folks given more to wearing suits and ties than hoods and robes. During the White Citizens Councils' heyday, the groups claimed more than 1 million members. Although they weren't immune to violence — Byron De La Beckwith, who murdered civil-rights leader Medgar Evers in 1963, was a member — the councils generally used their political and financial pull to offset the effects of ""forced integration."" 

Once the segregation battle was lost, the air went out of the White Citizens Councils. The councils steadily lost members throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Sensing the need for a new direction, Baum, formerly the CCA's Midwest field director, called together a group of 30 white men, including former Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox and future Louisiana Congressman John Rarick, for a meeting in Atlanta in 1985. Together, they cooked up a successor organization: the Council of Conservative Citizens. 

Like the original White Citizens Councils, the CCC is made up of local chapters, some of which are active in civic affairs beyond the national group's racist agenda. And until the 2000s, some of the group's ""uptown"" attitude remained, as meetings resembled Rotary Club events more than Klan outings and regularly featured politicians as keynote speakers. 

Most Americans learned of the CCC in late 1998, when a scandal erupted over prominent Southern politicians' ties to the brazenly racist group. After it was revealed that former Congressman Bob Barr (R-Ga.) gave the keynote speech at the CCC's 1998 national convention and that then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) had spoken to the group five times, both claimed they knew nothing about the CCC. However, an Intelligence Report investigation, publicized by national television and newspaper reports, made clear what the CCC really was: a hate group that routinely denigrated blacks as ""genetically inferior,"" complained about ""Jewish power brokers,"" called LGBT people ""perverted sodomites,"" accused immigrants of turning America into a ""slimy brown mass of glop,"" and named Lester Maddox, the now-deceased, ax handle-wielding, arch-segregationist former governor of Georgia, ""Patriot of the Century."" 

As evidence of widespread association between Southern GOP officeholders and the CCC mounted, Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson took the unusual step in 1998 of asking party members to resign from the group because of its racist views. A resolution moved through the U.S. Congress ""condemning the racism and bigotry espoused by the Council of Conservative Citizens,"" although it ultimately failed. (Congress had earlier condemned the black supremacist Nation of Islam in a similar manner, but failed to do the same with the CCC. Republican Party leaders, likely embarrassed by Lott's very public connection to the CCC, managed to defeat the censure effort.)

But six years later, many Southern lawmakers were still pandering to and meeting with the CCC — and still pleading ignorance. According to a 2004 Intelligence Report review of the Citizens Informer, no fewer than 38 federal, state and local elected officials had attended CCC events between 2000 and 2004, most of them giving speeches to local chapters of the hate group. 

Since the 1998/1999 scandal stripped much of the remaining varnish off the CCC's mainstream pretensions, the extremist views expressed on its website and in its newspaper have become increasingly crude. ""What do you call ... four blacks, three Hispanics, three Russian Jews, and one white guy?"" the CCC home page asked in 2003. ""The FBI's Most Wanted List!"" Another day, the home page ran photos of accused Beltway snipers John Muhammad and John Malvo, 9/11 conspirator Zacharias Moussaoui and shoe-bomber Richard Reed. ""Notice a Pattern Here?"" asked a caption underneath the four photos. ""Is the face of death black after all?"" In 2002, the Web site featured a photo of Daniel Pearl, the ""Jewish Wall Street Journal reporter"" who had just been decapitated by Islamic terrorists. In the photo, Pearl was shown with his ""mixed-race wife, Marianne."" The headline above the couple's picture was stunning even for the CCC: ""Death by Multiculturalism?""

The danger of ""race-mixing"" has been a consistent theme for the group since the days of the White Citizens Councils. ""God is the author of racism,"" said one story on the CCC's website in 2001. ""God is the One who divided mankind into different types. ... Mixing the races is rebelliousness against God."" After the NAACP declared its boycott of South Carolina in 1999 because the state continued to fly the Confederate battle flag over its Capitol dome, the CCC distributed a mock advertisement proclaiming, ""South Carolina Now Has Whiter Beaches!"" The Citizens Informer item urged whites to vacation in South Carolina and ""enjoy a civil liberty that has been denied to them for many years at hotels, restaurants and beaches: the freedom to associate with just one's own people.""

Along with theological arguments, the Citizens Informer has published countless stories detailing ""scientific"" evidence for white people's inherent superiority. Writing about Brown vs. Board of Education in 2004, contributor Michael Polignano noted that many commentators were using the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling striking down public school segregation to talk about ""how far America still falls short of racial equality."" According to Polignano, that lack of progress ""should surprise no one, because racial inequality is genetic and cannot be changed by social programs. ... Blacks are on average probably less intelligent than Whites and more aggressive, impulsive and prone to psychopathologies."" To prove this point, a 2005 article in the Citizens Informer written in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina described ""[a]ccounts of little children — girls and boys —being gang raped, rescue vans and copters being repeatedly fired upon by mobs of violent blacks, anarchy, chaos, confusion, looting even by black police officers."" 

More recently, the CCC has focused very heavily on battling non-white immigration. The group jumped quite early on the ""threat"" it perceived was posed by immigration, holding a rally against immigration in Cullman, Ala., in 1998 that featured major nativist hate group leaders Barbara Coe and Glenn Spencer, both of whom worked to pass the punishing California anti-immigrant Proposition 187 (the rally was also attended by an unrobed Klan leader and a top official of the Federation for American Immigration Reform). The CCC has held rallies nearly every year since then against immigration and the topic is addressed regularly at the CCC's biannual conferences, which have included as participants CCC leaders and prominent racists including Jared Taylor, editor of the anti-black and anti-Latino race science newsletter American Renaissance, and Don Black, founder of the first hate site on the web, Stormfront.org. 

CCC meetings have rarely featured politicians as speakers since the 2004 Intelligence Report exposé that exposed the fact that dozens of GOP politicians (and one Democrat) had been speaking at the group's events despite GOP chief Jim Nicholson's warnings in 1998. But a few have continued to associate with the CCC. In 2005, George Wallace Jr., the son of the late segregationist Alabama governor who was then an Alabama Public Service commissioner, spoke at the group's summer conference. In June 2008, another Alabama politician, state Sen. Charles Bishop (R-Jasper), addressed the group. Bishop's speech appealed to the assembled CCC crowd, particularly when he denounced the idea that Southern states should apologize for having sanctioned slavery. Bishop said that ""atonement equals reparations"" — meaning that apologies would surely be greeted by demands for financial payback by black Americans. Bishop received a standing ovation from the audience and he and his wife posed for pictures with members afterwards. 

And in 2009 Republican Mississippi State Sen. Lydia Chassaniol spoke to the group. She gave a rabble-rousing speech on ""Cultural Heritage in Mississippi."" In a brief history of the state since 1540, Chassaniol complained that the U.S. was in decline, as evidenced by tributes to Michael Jackson, a ""pedophile who's being celebrated."" She indicated that the government wants to ""take from those who have and give to those who don't want to work for it."" And she worried that the 2010 national census might hand over government ""to the radical left."" Chassaniol confirmed to the Southern Poverty Law Center that she is a member of the CCC, which she described as a ""conservative organization.""

A June 2011 barbeque held in Tennessee showcased another set of unsavory relationships maintained by the CCC. According to postings on website of the CCC’s Tennessee chapter, members of Volksfront and Blood and Honour, two notorious and violent racist skinhead groups, joined CCC members to network and discuss “ideas and plans to make a positive impact on our regions.” The then-head of the CCC, Gordon Baum, referred to the meeting as a “no-no” after stating that the chapter was not supposed to meet with “costumed Nazis.”

On April 7, 2013, Leonard R. Wilson of Jasper, Alabama, died. He was a charter member of the CCC, as well as the organization’s national secretary and the Alabama state coordinator. He earned the nickname of ""Flagpole"" Wilson by climbing a flagpole during 1956 anti-integration riots at the University of Alabama to shout, ""Keep 'Bama white!""

A few months later, at the organization’s 2013 annual conference in Winston-Salem, N.C., Bill Lord addressed a crowd of around 75 attendees, imploring them to think locally and “get you some bigots together and take some organizations over.” Lord, who was then the chairman of the Carroll County Democratic Party in Mississippi, was referring to positions such as the school board. He then went on to refer to Greenwood, Miss., as “the Congo” because of its large black population. The gathering only went further sideways from there, with Keith Alexander of the “Political Cesspool,” a racist and anti-Semitic far-right radio program, decrying Jewish political power and influence before stating, “The only people who can be trusted to be in charge are white people.” Another attendee, John Shudlick, five-time mayor of Ocean Ridge, Fla., encouraged the crowd to use critical thinking in the struggle for the country’s soul. According to Shudlick, the “six million figure [Jews killed in the holocaust] is a dirty filthy lie.”

In November of the same year, the CCC and the neo-Confederate League of the South held their first joint protest together against the removal of a statue of Tom Watson, an infamous racist and anti-Semite known for playing a key role in instigating the lynching of Leo Frank in 1915, from the steps of the Georgia state Capitol. The two groups’ membership rolls overlap a good deal; however, this event was demonstrative of the CCC’s longstanding strategy, focused on small, local rallies, being adopted by other hate groups.

Gordon Baum, the CCC’s founder and longtime leader, died at the age of 74 in early March 2015, leaving the future of the CCC uncertain. However, Baum’s death did little to slow down the activities of several of the group’s board members. Just weeks later, Jared Taylor and Sam Dickson, both well-known racist activists, appeared as speakers at the Russian Conservative Forum in St. Petersburg, Russia, alongside some of Europe’s most extreme, right-wing fringe.

Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy.""

Smythe worked as an economist for the Department of Agriculture from 1934-1947, for the Central Statistics Board from 1937-1938, for the Department of Labor from 1938-1941, and for the Federal Communications Commission from 1943-1948.  In 1948, Smythe joined the newly created Institute for Communications Research at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  In 1963, he took a position at the University of Saskatchewan where he worked until 1973 when he became Chair of the Communication Department at Simon Fraser University.

Smythe's scholarship focused primarily on mass media and telecommunications, and he is widely viewed as a pioneer of the political economy of communications tradition of communication scholarship.  Smythe's scholarship was informed by Marxism, and he remained politically active outside of academia for most of his life.  Of particular note is his involvement with the American League Against War and Fascism (also known as the American League for Peace and Democracy).  Because of his activism and his scholarship, particularly during the McCarthy era and beyond, Smythe claimed that his activities were being tracked by U.S. intelligence agencies.  In fact, during his application to (and eventual hire at) the University of Illinois, reports suggest that J. Edgar Hoover refused to release his FBI files to the university administration.  As a result, the attorney general intervened, and Smythe received the job.

If for any reason any portion of this request is denied, please provide written notice of the records that were withheld, and the specific legal justification for the denial. Please also provide the name and address of the officer(s) or body to which my appeal should be directed.

I also hereby request a waiver of both search and duplication fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(1l) and (a)(4XA)(iii). MuckRock is entitled to a waiver of search fees under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(11) because MuckRock is a member of the news media. cf. National Security Archive v. Department of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1387 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (defining news media within FOIA context).

MuckRock is a registered non-profit, collaborative news site that has recognized as been recognized by the Sunlight Foundation, The Freedom of the Press Foundation,the Global Investigative Journalism Network (https://gijn.org/member/muckrock/) (all of which expensively employ FOIA in their reporting).

MuckRock via it's website (muckrock.com) regularly obtains and publishes information about the operations and activities of government through FOIA and uses its editorial staff and contributors to turn this information into distinct works, and publishes and disseminates these works to the public. As it intends to do likewise with the records it receives in response to this inquest.

MuckRock also is entitled to a complete waiver of both search fees and duplication fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Under this provision: Records shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees established under clause (ii) if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4XAXiii).

In addition, if records are not produced within twenty (20) business days. Muckrock is entitled to a complete waiver of search and duplication fees under Section 6(b) of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, which amended FOR at 5 U.S.C. § (a)(4)(A)(viii).

MuckRock is a 501(c)(3), not-for-profit, educational organization, and, by definition, it has no commercial purpose. MuckRock exists to educate the public about the operations and activities of government, as well as to increase public understanding about the importance of ethics and the rule of law in government.

The particular records requested herein are sought as part of MuckRock's ongoing efforts to document the operations and activities of of government agencies and to educate the public about these operations and activities. Once MuckRock obtains the requested records, it intends to analyze them and disseminate the results of its analysis.

There is a clear public interest case in having these files released therefore I request fees be waived for the following reasons:

1) The questions raised about the government's motivations, integrity and judgment on this issue(s).

2) Any wrongdoing by the subject(s) in question, the government and/or other federal officials the materials may expose.

3) The subject is of ""widespread and exceptional media interest"" the widespread public interest and reporting on this case.

4) As a journalist and member of muckrock.com, I am engaged in reporting and disseminating information to the public, free of charge.

The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.

Schorr died peacefully from an apparent ""short illness"" on July 23, 2010, at a Washington, D.C. hospital.

In 1971, after a dispute with White House aides, Schorr's friends, neighbors, and co-workers were questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his habits. They were told that Schorr was under consideration for a high-level position in the environmental area. Schorr knew nothing about it. Later, during the Watergate hearings, it was revealed that Nixon aides had drawn up what became known as Nixon's Enemies List, and Daniel Schorr was on that list. Famously, Schorr read the list aloud on live TV, surprised to be reading his own name in that context. 

Schorr provoked intense controversy in 1976 when he received and made public the contents of the secret Pike Committee report on illegal Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and FBI activities. Called to testify before Congress, he refused to identify his source on First Amendment grounds, risking imprisonment. This did not mollify CBS executives, and Schorr ultimately resigned from his position at CBS in September 1976. Although scolded at first for his television report by former CIA director Richard Helms, Schorr was vindicated by the text of the Pike Committee, which he obtained from an undisclosed source and sent to The Village Voice.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.","1379793-0, DOJ-AP-2019-002042",False,1439,460,Subjects Matter: FBI Files,,0.00,2017-07-08 04:00:00+00:00,2017-08-04,2020-03-13 04:56:00+00:00,daniel-schorr-39752

He came to public attention in July 2003 when an unauthorised discussion he had off the record with BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan about the British government's dossier on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was cited by Gilligan and led to a major controversy. Kelly's name became known to the media as Gilligan's source and he was called to appear on 15 July before a parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee investigating the issues Gilligan had reported. Kelly was questioned aggressively about his actions. He was found dead two days later.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair's government set up the Hutton Inquiry, a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death. The inquiry concluded that Kelly had committed suicide, with the cause of death as ""haemorrhage due to incised wounds of the left wrist"" in combination with ""coproxamol ingestion and coronary artery atherosclerosis"". Lord Hutton also decided that evidence related to the death, including the post-mortem report and photographs of the body, should remain classified for 70 years. In October 2010, Hutton claimed that he had done so to protect Kelly's wife and daughters from the distress of further media reports about the death, saying: ""My request was not a concealment of evidence because every matter of relevance had been examined or was available for examination during the public inquiry. There was no secrecy surrounding the postmortem report because it had always been available for examination and questioning by counsel representing the interested parties during the inquiry.""

In 2009 a group of British doctors who had not had access to the evidence—including Michael Powers, a physician, barrister, and former coroner—challenged Hutton's verdict, offering their opinion based on published reports that the cause of death was untenable; they argued that the artery is small and difficult to access, and severing it would not have triggered sufficient blood loss to cause death. This opinion was challenged by several forensic pathologists who also had not had access to the evidence, who told The Guardian that the combination of Kelly's heart disease and the overdose would have meant a smaller loss of blood could have killed him than would be needed to kill a healthier person. In August 2010 the former leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, called for a full inquest, and Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General for England and Wales, confirmed that he was considering re-opening it.

In October 2010, the postmortem—including the pathologist's 14-page report and the six-page toxicology report—was made public, reiterating the conclusion of the Hutton report. Powers maintains that questions remain about the amount of blood found at the scene and the number of pills taken.",1382160-000,False,1406,1080,Subjects Matter: FBI Files,,0.00,2017-08-10 04:00:00+00:00,2017-09-08,2018-07-02 04:56:00+00:00,david-kelly-41701

Desmond Patrick Costello (31 January 1912 – 23 February 1964) was a New Zealand linguist, soldier, diplomat, university professor who was accused of being an agent for the Soviet GRU and of having sparked the first in a series of spy scandals in the 1960s which brought down the Macmillan government in the UK.

He was born in Auckland, New Zealand.

Eminent New Zealand author Sir James McNeish researched and wrote a biography of Paddy Costello entitled The Sixth Man: the extraordinary life of Paddy Costello (Random House, 2007). In the preface to this book, Philip Knightley writes that ""This long overdue biography sets the record straight. It convincingly shows that the slim evidence for the traitor charge was invented, exaggerated and misinterpreted."" Costello's MI5 file was released to the public in April 2017, but it fails to settle the issue of his supposed treachery.

Note that I am looking for information on the origins, use or assignment of the term ESP-X for FBI files, such as in the ""Majestic 12"" file posted to the FBI website. Note that a CRS search alone will not count as reasonably and carefully calculated to locate the records, as I am not requesting records on a single case.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.

EmmaBest,European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO),Completed,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/european-american-unity-and-rights-organization-euro-31226/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO). Founded in 2000 under a different name by the former Klan leader and notorious neo-Nazi David Duke, the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO) claims to fight for ""White Civil Rights"" for ""European and Americans Wherever They May Live."" Beyond hosting a website, whitecivilrights.com, and staging an occasional conference, EURO is a paper tiger, serving primarily as a vehicle to publicize Duke's writing and sell his books. 

In January of 2000, David Duke announced that he was creating a new organization to help protect the rights and heritage of European Americans. The group, NOFEAR (the National Organization for European American Rights), was modeled on civil rights groups like the NAACP and the National Council of La Raza and meant to fight against what Duke argued was widespread discrimination against whites by minorities. Duke told reporters in 2000 that white people in America were facing a ""genocide,"" and wrote in letter to the Shreveport Times that European Americans were ""internally displaced people"" deserving of refugee status and government protection. In 2001, a lawsuit was filed against Duke for trademark infringement by No Fear Inc., a sportswear company. To avoid legal action, Duke changed the name of his organization to EURO. 

EURO's founder had far more serious problems with the law. An investigation of Duke for mail fraud prompted a federal raid on his two-story house in Mandeville, La. On Nov. 16, 2000, federal agents carted away 22 boxes of papers, computer discs, credit card records and other documents. At the time, Duke was in Russia on his fourth visit. From a safe distance, Duke insisted on his innocence. ""Make no mistake about it,"" he wrote in a NOFEAR newsletter, ""this probe is nothing more than a political assassination on the part of government officials who are seeking to silence my voice on our European heritage and rights."" In the meantime, Duke said, he was moving to Moscow ""to struggle against people of other colors and Jews."" It is clear that Duke understood perfectly that he was in trouble back home. That's why he spent the next two years traveling in Russia and throughout Europe giving speeches and hobnobbing with other extremists. Overall, Duke sought to give the impression that he was devoted to building a transnational white rights movement. The reality, however, was that Duke spent most of his time selling books, meeting privately with prominent extremists, and giving paid talks. 

By late 2002, Duke's attorney was negotiating a plea agreement for his client, who had grown tired of being a nationalist without a nation. When news of the plea became public, Bruce ""Vince"" Breeding, an important figure in the National Alliance and by then the national director of EURO, said Duke was pleading because he would surely lose in court at the hands of a mostly black jury. EURO communiqués painted the group's founder as ""a living martyr for our cause."" 

On Dec. 14, Duke pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud — raising money under false pretenses that was later spent on personal investments or lost at the craps tables in three states — and another of making false statements on his tax return by vastly understating his 1998 income. Under terms of the plea agreement, signed by Duke, his lawyer and Assistant U.S. Attorney Carter Guice, he was sentenced to one-and-a-half years in federal prison in 2003.

While Duke was incarcerated, Breeding continued to run EURO, posting entries by noted white supremacists on its website and carrying on Duke's efforts to rescue white people from the alleged depravity of the Jews and other minority groups. Yet, as a 2003 Intelligence Report exposé revealed, Breeding was simultaneously running a New Orleans-based porn site, the now defunct xsitenola.com, while producing a companion adult magazine, Xsite. Given the straight-arrow reputation of the National Alliance and Duke's pretensions to being a sophisticated intellectual, Breeding's sleazy side job proved to be embarrassing for the movement. (It didn't help that his magazine advertised an escort service specializing in women of color, a definite no-no for neo-Nazis.) In late 2003, Breeding quit his job as the national director of EURO. Fifty-four-year-old Kenny Knight, a former leader in Duke's National Association for the Advancement of White People and a member of the Council of Conservative Citizens hate group, was named Breeding's successor. 

Over the 2004 Memorial Day weekend, Duke was welcomed back from his stay in prison with a well-attended racist unity conference in Louisiana, co-sponsored by EURO and several other hate groups including the National Alliance, the Council of Conservative Citizens and the Holocaust-denying Barnes Review. Several white-supremacist leaders signed Duke's ""New Orleans Protocol,"" a set of principles ""pledging adherents to a pan-European outlook"" — and, ironically enough, to ""honorable and ethical behavior."" An estimated 67,000 racists from around the world logged onto EURO's website for a simulcast of the main festivities. 

In recent years, EURO has accomplished little. Its website still posts articles decrying the fate of white people in America and calls for ""Equal Rights for Whites"" and the ""Preservation of Our European-American Heritage."" But it mostly serves as a link to Duke's own site, www.duke.org, where visitors can view his articles, listen to his radio programs, and buy his merchandise. 

In 2008, EURO did add one arrow to its quiver. While announcing plans to hold another conference, this time in Memphis, the group also noted that Ed Fields, the aged and longtime segregationist, had quit publishing his newspaper, The Thunderbolt, and joined up with Duke. Duke's newsletter said that the move would double both the size of EURO and the number of subscribers to The Duke Report.

My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.",1363736-000,False,1636,1485,Haters: Documenting Extremist and Hate Groups,,0.00,2016-12-23 05:00:00+00:00,2017-01-25,2017-05-02 00:00:00+00:00,european-american-unity-and-rights-organization-euro-31226

A November 15th, 1962, article in the Coe Cosmos campus newspaper describes the creation of this group and described an upcoming meeting on November 16th. What follows is a copy of an article describing the group an their activities in 1962:

""On October 26 a group of students interested in civil rights and peace got together and organized the Committee on National and International Affairs (COINA). The purpose of this group is to discuss ways to peace and disarmament and promote action on civil rights. A temporary planning committee consisting of Barbara Steidemann, Chairman; Jim Ruffins, Lucien Cerwin, Charles Vosseler, Jon Duerr, and Carolyn Bunte was appointed to map out future programs from the group. At the first meeting Mr. William Higgs of Mississippi, who was James Meredith's lawyer, was the resource speaker. He emphasized the need to have student groups actively concerned with the problem of race relations and also the need for fundraising campaigns to support national groups such as SNCC and CORE. This Friday CONIA will present a program dealing with the other side of its purpose, peace and disarmament. Mr. Larry Martin from the American Friends Service Committee will show a film ""Which Way the Wind."" This is a play written by the AFSC which dramatically presents the issue of peace in a nuclear age. All students are urged to attend this meeting which will be held Friday, November 16, at 7:30 in the TUB conference room.""

Here is a link to a cached version of the article from Newspapers.com: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Jwr4oH0fE2kJ:https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/32705676/&hl=en&gl=ge&strip=1&vwsrc=0

One of the participants in this group was CHARLES MARTIN VOSSELER who is currently a criminal wanted by the FBI. Vosseler's participation in this meeting does not appear to be common knowledge, and information about this 1960s-era civil rights group is virtually non existent on the internet. Vosseler's participation in the group appears to go against his later activities when he lived in close proximity to a white supremacist community in Oklahoma.

This new policy was described in a December 2014 letter sent to the Attorney General by Senator Chuck Grassley (see http://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/leahy-grassley-press-administration-use-cell-phone-tracking-program): ""We wrote to FBI Director Comey in June seeking information about law enforcement use of cell-site simulators.  Since then, our staff members have participated in two briefings with FBI officials, and at the most recent session they learned that the FBI recently changed its policy with respect to the type of legal process that it typically seeks before employing this type of technology.  According to this new policy, the FBI now obtains a search warrant before deploying a cell-site simulator, although the policy contains a number of potentially broad exceptions and we continue to have questions about how it is being implemented in practice.  Furthermore, it remains unclear how other agencies within the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security make use of cell-site simulators and what policies are in place to govern their use of that technology. [....] For example, we understand that the FBI’s new policy requires FBI agents to obtain a search warrant whenever a cell-site simulator is used as part of a FBI investigation or operation, unless one of several exceptions apply, including (among others): (1) cases that pose an imminent danger to public safety, (2) cases that involve a fugitive, or (3) cases in which the technology is used in public places or other locations at which the FBI deems there is no reasonable expectation of privacy.""

As stated on the FBI website, acceptable proof of death includes 'an FBI file that indicates a person is deceased.' These individuals are listed as deceased in your Bureau's RIDS 'Dead List' of FBI files on deceased individuals. The files were originally part of the 'FBI OFFICIALS' index/list. For your convenience, a copy of the 'Dead List' may be viewed at https://archive.org/details/FBIRIDsDeadList2015 in a variety of formats. 

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written on the U.S. Intelligence Community, succinctly describing and analyzing events such as the Nosenko affair. These articles have been widely disseminated, with analytics reporting over 100,000 readers for a single article on Yuri Nosenko. 

I request that all fees be waived. Since the files are about FBI officials and representatives of the US government, it clearly concerns the operations or activities of the US Government. I believe that the disclosure is informative and will help the public understand the operations and activities of the US Government, particularly the people responsible for those operations and activities. Specifically since the files describe FBI personnel and operations, the disclosure will contribute significantly to public understanding of FBI personnel and operations, as well as the history of the Bureau itself. The requested documents will be made freely available to other members of the news media as well as the general public and uploaded to the National Security collection of the non-profit Internet Archive. This request is not being made for commercial purposes.",1350059-000,False,1876,1072,,,0.00,2016-04-27 04:00:00+00:00,2016-11-01,2018-07-10 04:56:00+00:00,fbi-officials-25423

FAIR leaders have ties to white supremacist groups and eugenicists and have made many racist statements. Its advertisements have been rejected because of racist content. FAIR’s founder, John Tanton, has expressed his wish that America remain a majority-white population: a goal to be achieved, presumably, by limiting the number of nonwhites who enter the country. One of the group’s main goals is upending the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a decades-long, racist quota system that limited immigration mostly to northern Europeans. FAIR President Dan Stein has called the Act a ""mistake.""

John Tanton founded the Federation for American Immigration Reform on Jan. 2, 1979, in Washington D.C. Roger Conner, an environmental lawyer, was appointed executive director, while Tanton served as the chairman of the board of directors. Before establishing FAIR, Tanton had experience working with groups concerned about how population growth affected the environment. Tanton served in several Sierra Club leadership posts, and he had been the president of Zero Population Growth, a group founded by biologist and longtime FAIR adviser Paul Ehrlich, from 1975 to 1977.

The founding of FAIR was a major change for Tanton. But he was driven to shift his efforts to the battle against immigration by his increasing concern that it was the primary cause of population growth. As a result, FAIR focuses exclusively on immigration issues. Its goal, according to its website, is to set immigration quotas ""at the lowest feasible levels"" and to prevent all illegal immigration. The group attempts to appear moderate, even though its record is extreme, particularly on racial issues. This strategy has paid off: In August 2009, FAIR President Dan Stein boasted that FAIR leaders had testified before Congress about 100 times.

In its early years, FAIR was known for frequent op-ed pieces and controversial advertisements. In December 1980, it ran an ad in the Rocky Mountain News with the headline: ""Our Grandparents Came To America To Escape Poverty And Despair. Will Our Children Want To Leave For The Same Reasons?"" The implication was that unless immigration policies were reformed, immigrants would swarm the United States, undermine job prospects for Americans and put an end to American prosperity.

In 1988, Dan Stein replaced Roger Conner as executive director. Stein had been an employee of FAIR since 1982; before that, he was the executive director of the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI), which was incorporated under FAIR's tax exemption and still serves as FAIR's legal arm. Conner became FAIR's president; this meant that Stein took over the responsibilities of running FAIR while Conner focused on fundraising.

On Oct. 9, 1988, the Arizona Republic published excerpts from embarrassing memos that had been sent by Tanton and Conner to members of FAIR's leadership. The documents were known as the WITAN memos; they came from an October 1986 conference in which Tanton met with a number of anti-immigration activists for a strategy session. The memos revealed Tanton's innermost, and controversial, thoughts. Tanton warned of a ""Latin onslaught,"" complained of Latinos' allegedly low ""educability."" He asked, ""Will Latin American migrants bring with them the tradition of the mordida (bribe), the lack of involvement in public affairs, etc.?"" He also wondered: ""Can homo contraceptivus [meaning whites] compete with homo progenitiva [meaning Latinos] if borders aren't controlled? Or is advice to limit ones [sic] family simply advice to move over and let someone else with greater reproductive powers occupy the space?""

In the memos, Tanton, sounding much like the Klan of the 1920s, expressed concerns over the role of the Catholic Church in the United States, a favorite topic of his. He worried that the Church would capitalize on the Catholic faith of Latino immigrants to exert more political influence in the U.S. Specifically, he thought the church would try to subvert the division between church and state and limit abortion and birth control.

Linda Chavez, then the executive director of another group founded by John Tanton and of which he was then president, U.S. English, resigned because of the memos, calling them ""repugnant and not excusable"" and ""anti-Catholic and anti-Hispanic."" Several members of U.S. English's board, including Walter Cronkite and Arnold Schwarzenegger, also quit the group, and Tanton resigned. But there was no fallout for Tanton with his colleagues at FAIR; there, Tanton was supported and a committee created to craft his defense for the incendiary comments in the WITAN memos.

The memos were far from the sum of Tanton's extremism. As reports by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) would document, Tanton has a lengthy record of friendly correspondence with Holocaust deniers, a former Klan lawyer and leading white nationalist thinkers, including Jared Taylor (who wrote in 2005, ""When blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western civilization — any kind of civilization — disappears""). On another occasion, Tanton wrote a major FAIR funder to suggest she read the work of radical anti-Semitic professor Kevin MacDonald— to ""give you a new understanding of the Jewish outlook on life"" — and suggested that the entire FAIR board discuss the man's theories about the Jews. In a letter to FAIR board member Donald Collins, Tanton enthused over the work of John Trevor Sr. — a key architect of the bluntly racist Immigration Act of 1924 and a man who distributed pro-Nazi propaganda and warned shrilly of ""diabolical Jewish control"" of America — and said it should serve FAIR as ""a guidepost to what we must follow again this time."" Tanton has also made several racist comments, telling a reporter in 1997 that unless U.S. borders are sealed, America will be overrun by people ""defecating and creating garbage and looking for jobs.""

The WITAN memos reveal Tanton's keen awareness of the importance of seeming respectable. In one memo, he wrote: ""the issues we're touching on here must be broached by liberals. The conservatives simply cannot do it without tainting the whole subject."" But the publication of the memos did not halt FAIR's growth. In 1990, FAIR claimed 50,000 members.

Tanton's preoccupation with immigration appears to be based, at least in part, on race. In a March 3, 1993 memo to FAIR board member Otis Graham, he demonstrated his desire to limit the number of nonwhites living in the U.S. The memo concerned a new group Tanton wanted to start, which he would have named the League for European American Defense, Education, and Research, or LEADERs [sic].   According to another Tanton memo, he had hatched the idea with help from three prominent white nationalists: the Council of Conservative Citizens' Sam Francis, American Renaissance's Jared Taylor and Wayne Lutton, who edits Tanton's hate journal The Social Contract. Tanton wrote in his LEADERs memo: ""Projections by the U.S. Census Bureau show that midway into the next century, the current European-American majority will become a minority … This is unacceptable; we decline to bequeath to our children minority status in their own land."" Here, Tanton made it quite clear that the skin color of immigrants factored into his desire to limit immigration.

Despite Tanton's unsavory track record, longtime FAIR President Dan Stein has shrunk from any criticism of FAIR's founder; on the contrary, in 2009 he told the Washington Post that Tanton was a ""Renaissance man.""

Maybe Stein has vigorously defended Tanton because he has expressed similarly extreme positions. In 1991, Stein sent a report to FAIR's board of directors under the subject line: ""The Defenders of American culture Rise to the Call to Arms."" In the memo, which is archived at George Washington University's Gelman Library, Stein celebrated a new ""disdain"" in the media and among intellectuals for ""the political agenda of those who openly attack the contributions of Western Civilization."" He was particularly happy that ""multicultural and Politically Correct"" school curricula had come under criticism.

Stein's report expressed the hope that mounting criticism of multiculturalism would eventually lead to attacks on the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended years of racist immigration policy (under a national origins quota system heavily skewed against non-whites and even darker-skinned Europeans) and initiated a wave of non-white immigration to the U.S. For Stein, the 1965 Act was ""a key mistake in national policy"" and a ""source of error.""

In 1994, Tanton interviewed Stein for FAIR's oral history project, which is composed of transcribed audio interviews with about a dozen FAIR principals. In that interview, Stein again expressed his disgust for the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. He told Tanton that those who supported the 1965 reform wanted to ""retaliate against Anglo-Saxon dominance"" and that this ""revengism"" against whites had created a policy that is causing ""chaos and will continue to create chaos.""

Between 1985 and 1994, FAIR received around $1.2 million in grants from the Pioneer Fund. The Pioneer Fund is a eugenicist organization that was started in 1937 by men close to the Nazi regime who wanted to pursue ""race betterment"" by promoting the genetic lines of American whites. Now led by race scientist J. Philippe Rushton, the fund continues to back studies intended to reveal the inferiority of minorities to whites.

FAIR stopped receiving Pioneer Fund grants in 1994 due to bad publicity it received when the grants were made public. At the time, FAIR was backing California's punishing anti-immigrant Proposition 187, which would have denied education and health care to the children of undocumented immigrants in that state if it had not died as the result of court challenges. Stein and Tanton had led FAIR's efforts to win funding from Pioneer, and Stein said in 1993, before Pioneer's extremism was made public, that his ""job [was] to get every dime of Pioneer's money.""

After the bad publicity, FAIR denied that the Pioneer Fund money had any influence on its work or in any way influenced its programs. To manage the fallout, on March 16, 1994, Stein wrote a letter to Harry Weyher, then the president of the Pioneer Fund. Stein attached a draft of a document that he wanted Weyher to endorse and send out, titled ""Why the Pioneer Fund Supports the Immigration Reform Movement."" Stein wrote the piece as though Weyher had written it himself. One part read, ""We are pleased and proud that through financial support, we've made FAIR's important work possible."" Though FAIR stopped receiving grants from the fund, which require public disclosure, it continued to receive private financial support from Pioneer's leaders for several years. In early 1997, Tanton organized a gathering at the New York Racquet and Tennis Club, where three members of FAIR's board — Henry Buhl, Sharon Barnes and Alan Weeden — met with Harry Weyher. In the late 1990s, Tanton also vacationed with Pioneer Fund board member John Trevor Jr., who also provided private financial support to FAIR.

FAIR also has produced controversial media programming. In 1996, FAIR started a television program called ""Borderline."" The show lasted for about a year and featured a number of prominent white nationalists, including Sam Francis and Jared Taylor. ""Borderline"" often advanced ideas popular in white nationalist circles; particularly popular was the idea that immigrants are destroying American culture or displacing Western civilization with degenerate, Third World ways.

Lawrence Auster, a white nationalist who spoke in 1996 to a conference put on by American Renaissance and whose website ""A View from the Right"" is listed as a hate site by the SPLC, appeared on the show on April 1, 1996, making the argument that if the U.S. loses its white majority, it will be destroyed. The topic that day, according to host Dan Stein, was to ""take a politically incorrect look at American culture and Western Civilization."" Stein added, ""America, love it or lose it."" Auster argued that because of an ""invasion,"" ""America is in the process of dissolving as a nation."" Supposedly drawing on history, Auster warned that as demographic change occurs and ""the majority is threatened in its position,"" the result could be ""civil war."" Auster's particular concern that day was the loss of ""the historic European Anglo American culture."" Stein certainly seemed to agree with his guest's worries. ""How can we preserve America if it becomes 50% Latin American?"" he asked. Stein also said that Anglos were leaving Los Angeles because it had become ""a foreign country to them.""

Another prominent white nationalist who appeared on ""Borderline"" was naturalized English immigrant Peter Brimelow, who in 1999 would go on to found the anti-immigrant hate site VDARE.com. Brimelow authored Alien Nation, a book that argues America should remain white-dominated. In a discussion about Alien Nation on Aug. 5, 1996, Stein asked Brimelow whether ""America's social and economic elites seem to be writing off the whole idea of the nation-state."" He added: ""If they shift their loyalty from the nation-state, what are they loyal to?"" Brimelow argued that these same elites are creating the ""greatest transformation of any independent state in history"" by bringing in ""new minority groups that did not exist before."" Brimelow considered these elites to be ""treasonous,"" people who ""hate our traditional culture and they see immigration as a weapon to help destroy it."" ""Are they really patriots?"" Brimelow asked.

Stein asked Brimelow to talk more about his statement ""race is destiny in American politics."" Brimelow did, saying, ""you really alter the texture of the country by bringing in different ethnic groups."" Endorsing the invasion theory, Brimelow told one caller, ""you have areas of South Texas and so on that have essentially gone back to Mexico."" Stein later asked Brimelow whether this all meant ""the end of the United States?"" Brimelow's answer: ""Sure.""

In 1998, various nativists and nativist groups attempted to get the Sierra Club to take an anti-immigration stance. The effort culminated in a 1998 vote in which Sierra Club members determined whether the group would support immigration restrictions. FAIR was one of the groups that helped to put the measure on the Sierra Club ballot, and Dan Stein teamed up with then-CNN Crossfire host Pat Buchanan to advocate for it. Members ultimately chose to retain the Sierra Club's neutral stance on immigration policy in a 60%-40% vote. The Sierra Club was an important target for FAIR because it was considered a liberal group, and Tanton, who held leadership positions there in the 1970s and still had many allies, expressed in his WITAN memos that he thought that the Sierra Club would be less vulnerable to charges of racism when advocating against immigration.

In April 1999, FAIR attacked U.S. Senator Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) for supporting more visas for foreigners with technology skills. It ran a newspaper ad that placed a picture of Abraham, an Arab-American, alongside a picture of Osama bin Laden. It asked, ""Why Is a U.S. Senator Trying to Make It Easier for Osama bin Laden to Export Terrorism to the U.S.?"" FAIR's ads were widely condemned and caused former Senator Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) to resign from FAIR's advisory board. FAIR has also run other extremely controversial political advertisements, including one in 2000 in Iowa that was rejected by a TV station as ""borderline racist.""

Several FAIR officials have links to white supremacist hate groups. Rick Oltman, who for much of the 1990s was FAIR's western regional coordinator, spoke as part of a 1997 immigration panel sponsored by the Council of Conservative Citizens, a racist group that has described black people as a ""retrograde species of humanity."" Council publications at the time listed Oltman as a member. Jim Staudenraus, FAIR's eastern regional coordinator, participated in an anti-immigration conference in 2002 with white nationalist Jared Taylor. In 2007, a senior FAIR official met with leaders of Vlaams Belang, a Belgian political party that officials in that country outlawed in a previous incarnation (Vlaams Blok) as a ""criminal organization"" because of its racist, anti-immigrant views.

In late 2006, FAIR hired Joseph Turner as its western field representative after Oltman departed. Turner was the founder of the Southern California group Save Our State, a now-defunct anti-immigrant hate group that was known for attracting neo-Nazis to its rallies. Turner was on record before joining FAIR as saying that being a white separatist did not imply a person was racist. Turner once accused Mexican immigrants of turning California into a ""third world cesspool."" He left FAIR in December 2007 shortly after the SPLC, in tandem with publishing an extensive report on the group's racism that included Turner's inflammatory comments, designated FAIR as a hate group. FAIR representatives did not comment as to the reason for Turner's departure.
 
FAIR board members harbor extreme views and connections as well. Garrett Hardin, a now-deceased biologist, was a very close friend of Tanton's and an active board member of FAIR from the mid-1980s until around 1996. Like Tanton, he often expressed eugenicist views. Hardin was a longtime supporter of population control: In 1968, he wrote ""The Tragedy of the Commons,"" in which he argued that ""[the] freedom to breed is intolerable."" In a 1992 interview with Omni magazine, he argued against sending food to starving Ethiopians, noting that doing so would only ""encourage population growth."" In that interview, he lauded China for its ""one-child policy"" but lamented that the policy was not thorough enough. Former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm, a longtime member of FAIR's board of advisors, once said that ""new cultures"" in America were ""diluting what we are and who we are.""

Longtime FAIR board member Donald A. Collins writes frequently for the VDARE.com, an anti-immigrant hate site named after Virginia Dare, said to have been the first English child born in the New World. (VDARE is dedicated to bashing immigrants and has published the work of many white nationalists and anti-Semites.) Collins has been published in The Journal of Social, Political and Economic Studies, a journal run by eugenicist Roger Pearson. Collins' articles have focused on attacking the Catholic Church for its liberal stance on immigration. One accused Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony of selling out his country ""in exchange for more temporal power and glory."" Another claimed bishops were ""infiltrating and manipulating the American political process"" to dismantle the separation of church and state — the classic calumny directed at American Catholics for decades by the Klan and others. Another person linked to VDARE is Joe Guzzardi, a member of FAIR's board of advisors who worked as an editor of the site.

On Oct. 2, 2007, Julie Kirchner became FAIR's third executive director. Dan Stein had taken the position of FAIR president by that time. Stein retained his status as leader and public face of FAIR, while Kirchner managed the day-to-day operations.

In the late 2000s, FAIR become much more active in pushing anti-immigrant laws at the state and local level. Attorney Kris Kobach, who works for FAIR's legal arm, the Immigration Reform Law Institute, helped to write Arizona Senate Bill 1070. The bill, signed by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer on April 23, 2010, forces police officers to detain individuals who they suspect to be illegal immigrants and makes it a misdemeanor under state law for non-citizen immigrants to fail to carry their immigration papers. The law is currently caught up in the federal courts. Kobach earlier helped to pass anti-immigrant ordinances in Farmers Branch, Texas; Hazleton, Pa.; and other cities. These laws seek to punish those who aid and abet ""illegal aliens."" The laws have proven a massive financial burden to the towns that pass them and, in many cases, have sparked racial strife and economic disorder. The Hazleton ordinance, which was struck down by a federal appeals court in September, had left that community of about 20,000 on the hook for nearly $3 million in legal fees as of January 2011. The city is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Another FAIR initiative to end birthright citizenship provisions of the 14th Amendment, a longtime goal of the group, was launched in January 2011. IRLI, FAIR's legal arm, working in partnership with State Legislators for Legal Immigration (SLLI), announced a plan to halt what they call ""the misapplication of the 14th Amendment."" At the time of its adoption in 1868, the 14th Amendment ensured that the children of slaves could not be denied citizenship; it now ensures that almost all children born on U.S. soil are automatically granted U.S. citizenship.

SLLI is a coalition of about 70 legislators in 38 states dedicated to eliminating ""economic attractions"" for immigrants and their ""unlawful invasion"" of the U.S. The group is often described as the legislative arm of FAIR, which is apt given the group says on its website that it has a ""working partnership"" with FAIR. SLLI's legislators are the main instigators behind favored FAIR initiatives, including attempts at the state level to deny immigrants various rights through laws modeled on Arizona's S.B. 1070.

SLLI has grown dormant in recent years, and the Supreme Court in 2012 struck down most of SB 1070’s provisions as unconstitutional.

The 2012 election saw a renewed push for immigration reform at the federal level, with a bipartisan bill passing the Senate before collapsing in the House. In an effort to stop reform legislation, anti-immigrant front groups first created with the help of FAIR in the mid-2000s were revived and rebranded. Groups like Choose Black America and You Don’t Think for Me were replaced by the African American Leadership Council (AALC), a name replaced quickly by the Black American Leadership Alliance (BALA), and Alliance for Immigration Justice (AIJ). These groups, which ostensibly opposed reform because it would damage job prospects for minorities and hurt taxpayers, were made up of African Americans and Latinos. Many of them – such as Leah Durant, a former staffer at IRLI (FAIR’s legal arm), and Frank Morris, a longtime FAIR board member – had close ties to nativist organizations. BALA did manage to organize a rally in Washington – the “DC March for Jobs” – that brought together a few thousand activists, including some nativist extremists like D.A. King of Georgia.

Following the failure of reform legislation, FAIR found a new focus. As the number of children fleeing violence in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua spiked in the summer of 2014, FAIR and its allies began to target organizations aiding these unaccompanied minors. FAIR published a map on its website with the title, “Is the Border Crisis Coming to a Town Near You?” It named locales where minors were being resettled and the organizations helping in that effort. Protests organized by anti-immigrant activists took place in a number of locations, most infamously in Murrieta, California, where activists blocked a bus full of women and children on their way to an immigration-processing center. In Michigan, anti-Muslim activist Tamyra Murray, a state adviser for FAIR, organized a protest against the relocation of minors in Vassar.

Even without a major immigration reform bill to challenge, FAIR’s public statements in recent years show that the organization remains true to the white nationalist principles on which it was founded. In late December 2015, Dan Stein told supporters in a video message that without a moratorium on immigration, “we’re going to lose everything about what it means to be an American.”

Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy.""

Bureau/office FOIA Officers are responsible for tracking, managing and responding to FOIA requests for records in their organization's possession and control, and administering their organization's FOIA programs. In addition to Bureau/Office FOIA Officers, some bureaus/offices also have Regional FOIA Coordinators and Field Offices that process requests. Some bureaus/offices have their program offices (i.e., the offices whose records are the subject of the requests) prepare the responses to FOIA requests.

This letter constitutes a request under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (collectively, “FOIA/PA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 552, 552a, and the Department of Justice’s (“DOJ”) implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 16, by independent journalist Joshua Eaton. For purposes of this request, the definition of “records” includes, but is not limited to, documents, letters, faxes, memoranda, notes, reports, e-mail messages (including e-mails to and from personal e-mail accounts), other correspondence, orders, policy statements, data, technical evaluations or analysis, and studies. The definition of “records” expressly refers to materials already in existence, whether in physical or electronic form, and does not imply any need for DOJ to create new records.

A. Request for disclosure

I seek disclosure of any and all records or communications created from Jan. 8, 1947, to the date your office processes this request, inclusive, that were prepared, received, transmitted, collected, and/or maintained by the FBI relating or referring to David Robert Jones a/k/a David Bowie (born Jan. 8, 1947, in Brixton, London, U.K, and died Jan. 10, 2016, in New York City, N.Y., U.S.A.).

I request these records pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 16.3(a)(4) (""Where a request for records pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by ... submitting proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary)""). Mr. Jones died on Jan. 10. 2016, as reported in the New York Times and other media outlets. See John Pareles, ""David Bowie dies at 69; he transcended music, art and fashion,"" New York Times (Jan. 11, 2016), http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/arts/music/david-bowie-dies-at-69.html; Tara Bahrampour, ""David Bowie dies at 69; mesmerizing performer and restless innovator,"" Washington Post (Jan. 11, 2016), https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/singer-david-bowie-dies-at-69-mesmerizing-performer-of-many-alter-egos/2016/01/11/e133f63c-b859-11e5-99f3-184bc379b12d_story.html.

B. Search parameters

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.

C. Request for limitation of processing fees

I request a limitation of processing fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) (“fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by ... a representative of the news media”) and 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.11(c)(1)(i) and 16.11(d)(1) (“Search fees shall be charged for all requests — other than requests made by … representatives of the news media,” and “No search fee will be charged for requests by … representatives of the news media”). As a “representative of the news media,” I fit within this statutory and regulatory exemption. Fees associated with the processing of this request should, therefore, be limited accordingly.

I meet the definition of a “representative of the news media” because I am “an entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience.” See National Security Archive v. Department of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1387 (D.C. Cir. 1989).

I am a full-time, professional journalist who reports on issues related to national security, cybersecurity, human rights and religion. My reporting on these topics has appeared in the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, the Christian Science Monitor, Al Jazeera America, Al Jazeera English, Public Radio International (PRI), Salon, GlobalPost, and other publications. In addition, I am a former digital producer at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting and the former editor-in-chief of Spare Change News, both located in Boston, Mass. A complete list of my publications and my full résumé are available online at https://joshuaeaton.net.

Although I am a freelance journalist, my ongoing professional relationship with editors at a number of outlets ensures any articles I write based on these documents will be published, demonstrating “a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization,” as required by the definition of “representative of the news media” in C.F.R. § 16.11 (b)(6). Under that same regulation, “components shall also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.” Id.

This request is made as part of the news-gathering process and not for commercial purposes. As such, I am entitled to a limitation of processing fees.

In the event that processing fees cannot be limited, please inform me of the anticipated total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

D. Request for fee waiver

I additionally request a waiver of all costs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) (“Documents shall be furnished without any charge ... if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester”) and C.F.R. § 16.11(k)(1) (“Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below that established … where a component determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that … Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and … Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester”). This request is made as part of the news-gathering process and not for commercial purposes. As such, I am entitled to a fee waiver.

Disclosure in this case meets the statutory criteria, and a fee waiver would fulfill Congress’s legislative intent in amending FOIA. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“Congress amended FOIA to ensure that it be ‘liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters.’”).

Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. This request will further public understanding of government conduct; specifically, the FBI’s monitoring, surveillance, and infiltration of organizations on the basis of organizational membership, political views or affiliation, or participation in protest activities or demonstrations. This type of government activity concretely affects many individuals and groups and implicates basic privacy, free speech, and associational rights protected by the Constitution.

Moreover, disclosure of the requested information will aid public understanding of the implications of the Department of Justice’s decision to relax guidelines that previously restricted the FBI’s ability to spy on organizations without a threshold showing of suspected criminal activity. These restrictions were created in response to the Hoover-era FBI’s surveillance of politically active individuals and organizations, despite the lack of evidence that such individuals and organizations had been involved in any unlawful behavior. Understanding the scope of the FBI’s surveillance and infiltration of law-abiding organizations is, therefore, crucial to the public’s interest in understanding the consequences of the Department of Justice’s important change in policy.

As a “representative of the news media,” supra Section C, I am well-situated to disseminate the information I gain from this request to the general public, to targeted communities, and to groups that protect constitutional rights. Because I meet the test for a fee waiver, fees associated with responding to my FOIA/PA requests should be – and regularly are – waived.

The records requested are not sought for commercial use. I plan to disseminate the information disclosed as a result of this FOIA/PA request through the channels

In the event that fees cannot be waived, please inform me of the anticipated total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

E. Miscellany

Pursuant to applicable regulations and statute, I expect the determination of this request for documents within 20 days of your receipt of this request. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i) and 28 C.F.R. § 16.5(d)(4).

If this request is denied, in whole or in part, please justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions to FOIA/PA. DOJ must also release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. I reserve the right to appeal any decision to withhold any information in whole or in part, to deny the request to limit processing fees, or to deny the request for a fee waiver.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,
Joshua Eaton",20163781,False,1882,1489,,,0.00,2016-04-21 04:00:00+00:00,2016-05-19,,foiapa-request-prince-rogers-nelson-25351

This should include, but not be limited to, any correspondence about the development of the portal, as well as all phases of testing of the portal including ""bug"" reports or complaints received. 

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.",1367116-000,False,1589,215,,,0.00,2017-02-08 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-09,2020-11-13 04:56:00+00:00,foia-portal-dev-33063

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).

""Mr. Powers and Ms. Smith have both been genetically certified as members of the white race,"" read the fantastical piece. ""They wish to have a child. They may not do so without violating the Act and thereby risking serious penalty. The Mandatory Miscegenation Act was enacted by Congress after several years of public debate. It was hailed by President Muhammad as 'the most important, the most fundamental civil rights legislation in the history of our nation.'""

The IKA subscribes to a variety of grand conspiracy theories concerning Jewish control of the establishment, especially the American media and government. The IKA says that Jews are directing America's foreign relations to help Israel. Their beliefs derive from members' adherence to Christian Identity, a particularly radical religion that vilifies Jews and non-whites. ""WE BELIEVE the White, Anglo-Saxon, Germanic and kindred people to be God's true, literal Children of Israel,"" the IKA writes. ""Only this race fulfills every detail of Biblical Prophecy and World History concerning Israel and continues in these latter days to be heirs and possessors of the Covenants, Prophecies, Promises and Blessings YHVH God mad to Israel. … This chosen seedline making up the 'Christian Nations' (Gen. 35:11; Isa. 62:2; Acts 11:26) of earth stands far superior to all other peoples in their call as God's servant race (Isa. 41:8, 44:21; Luke 1:54)."" The creed can be generously deemed a false interpretation, as the cited Bible passages make absolutely no mention of white racial superiority. Through similar ""proof,"" the IKA lays claim to being the ""chosen people"" of the Bible, a key tenet of Christian Identity theology. ""History, archaeology, and the Bible now prove that ancient Anglo-Saxon-Celtic-Scythian people are all Caucasian descendants of the House of Israel,"" the IKA says.

The IKA's Dawson Springs, Ky., compound serves as a venue for the annual Nordic Fest, a festival of racist music that attracts an array of white supremacist groups and their families, including skinheads, neo-Nazis, and other Ku Klux Klan groups. At the Spring 2006 gathering, a speech by Steven Boswell of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement (NSM) provoked a brawl between the violent Vinlanders Social Club and the NSM.  The clash culminated in approximately 50 Vinlanders, headed by Eric ""The Butcher"" Fairburn, attacking five NSM members as Boswell's 10-year-old daughter screamed from the crowd, 'They're killing my daddy!""  IKA security stood by as the fight continued on before breaking up the warring racists.

Like other white supremacist groups, the IKA has in recent years focused its propaganda on illegal immigration. Though their website clearly states that the group does not condone violence, and that ""ANY MEMBER COMMITTING ANY ILLEGAL ACT DOES SO ON THEIR OWN,"" IKA members have been party to brutal and unprovoked violence.  Given the harsh anti-immigrant stance of IKA, it was not surprising when on July 30, 2006, two IKA members, Jarred R. Hensley, 24, of Cincinnati and Andrew R. Watkins, 26, of Louisville, attacked Jordan Gruver while the 16-year-old was enjoying the Meade County Fair in Brandenburg, Ky., because they thought he was Latino (they used racial slurs, including ""spic,"" during the attack). Gruver was beaten to the ground and kicked with steel-toed boots by his attackers, one of whom was 6 foot 5 inches and 330 pounds; Gruver weighed 150 pounds. The Klansmen cracked Gruver's ribs, broke his arm and broke his jaw. Hensley and Watkins were later sentenced to three-year prison terms for the attack. 

The SPLC filed a civil lawsuit against the IKA in July 2007, naming Ron Edwards, the IKA's founder, and several ranking members as defendants. By the summer of 2008, Edwards and several others had been deposed. During the trial, Edwards would defend himself by arguing that his racism consisted of only words and symbols. No matter how offensive his views might be to some people, he argued, he has a constitutional right to freedom of speech. ""Nobody in America should be persecuted for what they believe in,"" he said.

But the SPLC made the case that the First Amendment did not immunize Edwards' activities. Edwards, the SPLC lawyers argued, enlisted men with violent histories and then sent them out to recruit new members — all in an effort to line his pockets with membership dues. Rather than try to control his recruiters by prescribing rules to govern their conduct, Edwards added fuel to the fire by preaching hatred and encouraging violence. For these reasons, the SPLC legal team said, Edwards should be held liable for Gruver's injuries.

The trial was held in November 2008. After deliberating for more than six hours, the jury returned the verdict finding that Edwards had failed to properly supervise the Klansmen who attacked Gruver and that he had encouraged their violence. The jury awarded just over $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages to Gruver. Based on the jury's apportionment of responsibility for Gruver's attack, Edwards will be responsible for 20% of the compensatory award as well as the entire punitive damages award. Punitive damages are intended to punish a defendant and serve as a deterrent to future misconduct.

Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.

The agents who were killed were part of the detail assigned to protect the queen and Prince Philip during a weekend in the national park. The accident did not involve the royal motorcade, which passed through the area about 30 minutes later, the California Highway Patrol reported. The dead agents were George P.

EmmaBest,Jewish Defense League (JDL),Completed,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/jewish-defense-league-jdl-31232/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning the Jewish Defense League (JDL), a radical organization that preaches a violent form of anti-Arab, Jewish nationalism. Its late founder, Rabbi Meir Kahane, claimed that Jews face fierce anti-Semitism domestically and abroad and must protect themselves by any means necessary.

The JDL's position with regard to Israel is denial of any Palestinian claims to land and the calling for the removal of all Arabs from the ""Jewish-inherited soil."" The group has orchestrated countless terrorist attacks in the U.S. and abroad, and has engaged in intense harassment of foreign diplomats, Muslims, Jewish scholars and community leaders, and officials.

The Jewish Defense League was founded in 1968 by Rabbi Meir Kahane (born Martin Kahane). Its inception was part of the white backlash surrounding the New York City teachers' union strikes of 1968. The strikes brought to the surface racial tension between the predominantly Jewish teachers union, and black residents who were seeking greater control over their neighborhood schools. This, coupled with black demands for more civil service jobs, stirred the already hostile racial climate in Manhattan's neighborhoods and led working-class Jews in the outer boroughs to join the JDL. Kahane, who then wrote for The Jewish Weekly, an Orthodox periodical, flooded the tabloids with stories of blacks and Puerto Ricans terrorizing Jews in Manhattan. He dispatched JDL units to ""patrol"" predominantly Jewish areas, which ultimately led to an ethnic polarization of neighborhoods.

By 1970, however, the JDL had changed its primary cause to the plight of Soviet Jews. From that point on, the main objective of the JDL was to terrorize Soviet establishments in the U.S. to influence the communist nation to change its anti-Semitic policies — specifically, its ban on emigration to Israel. The terrorism become so severe that President Richard Nixon feared JDL activity would threaten the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty (SALT) II negotiations with the Soviet Union. In 1970 alone, the JDL committed five acts of terrorism, taking over the East Park Synagogue in Manhattan twice, in May and in November, to protest the Soviet U.N. Mission across the street. Throughout the 1970s and '80s, JDL members did everything from pouring blood over the head of a Soviet diplomat at a reception in Washington, D.C., to planting a smoke bomb in a Carnegie Hall performance of a Soviet orchestra. With each incident, the JDL claimed responsibility by phoning in its official slogan, in reference to the Holocaust, ""Never again!""

Members of the Jewish community in Moscow, however, made clear that they did not appreciate the JDL's efforts in the U.S., which were made allegedly on their behalf. In a New York Times article headlined ""Anti-Soviet Violence Here Upsets Jews in Moscow,"" Soviet Jews publicly made their case against the JDL. ""A number of Jewish activists refused permission to emigrate … feel that [anti-Soviet] harassment in New York hurts their cause and may give Soviet authorities an excuse to become even more intransigent,"" the newspaper reported.

Though Soviets were their main victims, the JDL has targeted anyone it considers a threat to the survival of radical Jewish nationalism. This includes U.S. and foreign diplomats, domestic radical-right organizations, Arab and Muslim activists, journalists and scholars, and Jewish community members who are simply not ""Jewish enough."" In 1975, six JDL members forced their way into the office of the executive vice president of the San Francisco Jewish Welfare Foundation and assaulted four staff members, including one who had been crippled from time spent in a concentration camp. The break-in was to protest the ""slow response"" of the federation to community needs of Jews in San Francisco.

The following year, JDL members began targeting diplomats of all nations who had voted for a U.N. resolution equating Zionism with racism. Three members were charged with invading and vandalizing the Mexican consulate in Philadelphia, and were later convicted of obstructing foreign officials and their duties, damaging property of a foreign government, and conspiracy.

The JDL also pitted its radical agenda against that of Nazis. In 1981, 20 members of the JDL took over the offices of the American Civil Liberties Union in Atlanta to protest its representation of neo-Nazis in court. Later that year, eight members attacked National Socialist Party of America leader Harold Covington with steel pipes as he approached NBC studios in New York, which led Covington to state, later that evening on the ""Tomorrow"" show, that ""all Jews should be gassed."" Earlier that year, the JDL had terrorized Boleslavs Maikovskis, an accused Nazi war criminal. A representative from the JDL took responsibility for throwing four gasoline firebombs into the Latvian ex-Nazi's home in Mineola, N.Y.

The JDL has experienced waves of internal strife throughout its years of operation, first of all with Kahane's emigration to Israel in 1971. Kahane's successor, David Fisch, was a Columbia University student who could not maintain unity in the early years. Kahane returned to the U.S. in 1974 to name Russel Kelner international chairman. Kelner was a former U.S. Army lieutenant, trained in guerilla warfare and ready to direct the JDL's paramilitary camp. In 1990, an Egyptian-born Islamic extremist, El Sayyid Nosair, assassinated Kahane during a Zionist conference in New York City, again throwing the group into disarray.

The JDL got some unwelcome international attention in 1994, when Baruch Goldstein, a JDL member, massacred 29 Palestinian Muslims kneeling in prayer at a mosque in the West Bank city of Hebron. The JDL's website justifies Goldstein's mass murder by saying ""Goldstein took a preventative measure against yet another Arab attack on Jews.""

In 2002, then-JDL Chairman Irv Rubin was jailed while awaiting trial on charges of conspiracy in planning bomb attacks against the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, Calif., and on the office of Arab-American Congressman Darrell Issa. Rubin slit his throat with a prison-issued safety razor, and fell or jumped off a balcony, sustaining injuries that led to his death several days later. Rubin's co-defendant in the case, Earl Krugel, met a similar fate in 2005 in a Phoenix prison when another inmate, reportedly, swung a bag containing a cinderblock into the back of Krugel's head, killing him. Krugel was murdered less than two months after being sentenced as part of a plea bargain.

In 2003, the Rubin family filed a wrongful death suit, citing allegedly suspicious circumstances. Upon the death of Rubin, Shelley Rubin, Irv's widow, named Bill Maniaci temporary leader of the JDL. In 2004, Rubin called for Maniaci to resign. When he refused, he was stripped of his title and membership, taking a large portion of the organization with him. After a lengthy legal battle over the JDL's intellectual property and website, Shelley Rubin won the title of permanent chairman and CEO of the JDL.

In 2009, never-before-seen FBI documents concerning Rubin's alleged confession and details about his death were published by the online news site TheEnterpriseReport.com.

The FBI deemed the league a right-wing terrorist group in their report ""Terrorism 2000/2001,"" but its domestic influence has waned in the years since, and today the JDL has no active chapters in the U.S. The JDL continues to wield steady membership through its website and blog, which distort news stories in order to vilify politicians, academics, and community leaders as ""anti-Semitic."" One such attack was entitled ""Carter the Jew Hater,"" and attacked the former president's book, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid. The JDL today has chapters in Eastern Europe, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Russia, and the United Kingdom.

In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.","1363773-000, DOJ-AP-2017-002415",False,1636,1496,Haters: Documenting Extremist and Hate Groups,,0.00,2016-12-23 05:00:00+00:00,2017-01-25,2017-05-12 00:00:00+00:00,jewish-defense-league-jdl-31232

Casablancas founded the Elite Model Management, a modeling agency, in 1972 in Paris, France.[1] Casablancas is credited for developing the concept of supermodel in the popular culture, turning models into celebrities that were featured in mass media as personalities rather than just faces.

Elite proved to be a success, grossing nearly $100 million in annual model bookings during the years that Casablancas ran the day-to-day operations of the agency.[1]
He also founded the John Casablancas Modeling and Acting Agency and School. The agency and school helped kick-start the careers of actors and actresses such as Julia Roberts and Jim Parsons.

Casablancas was born in Manhattan, New York City, on December 12, 1942, the youngest of three children of Fernando and Antonia Casablancas. His parents had fled to the United States to escape the Spanish Civil War during the 1930s.
In 1983 he had an affair with 16-year-old Stephanie Seymour until Stephanie broke off the relationship - this affair was the reason for his divorce from Jeanette Christiansen, his second wife. Casablancas is the father of Julian Casablancas, the lead vocalist of the American band, The Strokes. He also had three younger children with his third wife Aline Casablancas (née Aline Mendonça de Carvalho Wermelinger), who was the winner of Elite Model Look 1992 in Brazil.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.","1368175-000, DOJ-AP-2020-000602",False,1577,302,Subjects Matter: FBI Files,bilderberg,0.00,2017-02-20 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-20,2020-08-18 16:26:58.723305+00:00,joseph-johnson-33639

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

Licio Gelli (April 21, 1919 – December 15, 2015) was an Italian financier, chiefly known for his role in the Banco Ambrosiano scandal. He was revealed in 1981 as being the Venerable Master of the clandestine politically connected Free Mason lodge  Propaganda Due (P2).

Gelli was born in Pistoia, Tuscany. During the 1930s, Gelli volunteered for the Blackshirts expeditionary forces sent by Mussolini in support of Francisco Franco's rebellion in the Spanish Civil War. He participated in the Italian Social Republic with Giorgio Almirante, founder of the neofascist Italian Social Movement (MSI).  After a sales job with the Italian mattress factory Permaflex, Gelli founded his own textile and importing company.

In 1970, during the failed Golpe Borghese, he was delegated the role of arresting the Italian President, Giuseppe Saragat.[4] As Master of the Propaganda Due (P2) lodge, Gelli had ties with very high level personalities in Italy and abroad, in particular in Argentina, where he was a fugitive for many years. The Argentine Chancellor Alberto Vignes drafted with Juan Perón, who had returned from exile in 1973, a decree granting Gelli the Gran Cruz de la Orden del Libertador in August 1974, as well as the honorary office of economic counselor in the embassy of Argentina in Italy. Gelli publicly declared on repeated occasions that he was a close friend of Perón, although no confirmation ever came from South America. Gelli affirmed that he introduced Peron to Masonry and that this friendship was of real importance for Italy. He stated: ""Peron was a Mason, I initiated him in Madrid in Puerta de Hierro, in June 1973.""

According to a letter sent by Gelli to César de la Vega, a P2 member and Argentine ambassador to the UNESCO, Gelli commissioned P2 member Federico Carlos Barttfeld to be transferred from the consulate of Hamburg to the Argentine embassy in Rome. Gelli was also named minister plenipotentiary for cultural affairs in the Argentine embassy in Italy, thus providing him with diplomatic immunity.[5] He had four diplomatic passports issued by Argentina, and has been charged in Argentina with falsification of official documents. During the 1970s, Gelli brokered three-way oil and arms deals between Libya, Italy and Argentina through the Agency for Economic Development, which he and Umberto Ortolani owned.
Several members of the Argentine military junta have been found to be P2 members, such as Raúl Alberto Lastiri, Argentina's interim president from July 13, 1973 until October 12, 1973, Emilio Massera, part of Jorge Videla's military junta from 1976 to 1978, and José López Rega, the infamous founder of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (""Triple A""). The lodge P2, also known as the Propaganda Due, was also linked to the robbery of Juan Peron's severed hands.[10]
Alleged involvement in CIA activities in Italy.

In 1990 a report on RAI Television alleged that the CIA had paid Gelli to instigate terrorist activities in Italy.  Following this report, which also claimed that the CIA had been involved in the assassination of the Swedish Prime minister Olof Palme, then President Francesco Cossiga requested the opening of investigations while the CIA itself officially denied these allegations. Critics have claimed the RAI report to be a fraud because of the inclusion of testimony from Richard Brenneke, who claimed to be a former CIA agent and made several declarations concerning the October surprise conspiracy. Brenneke's background was also investigated by a U.S. Senate subcommittee, which dismissed Brenneke's claims of CIA employment.

Gelli's downfall started with the Banco Ambrosiano scandal, which led to a 1981 police raid on his villa and the discovery of the P2 covert lodge. On March 17, 1981 a police raid on his villa in Arezzo led to the discovery of a list of 962 persons composed of Italian military officers and civil servants involved in Propaganda Due (also known as ""P2""), a clandestine lodge expelled from the Grande Oriente d'Italia Masonic organization. A list of alleged adherents was found by the police in Gelli's house in Arezzo in March 1981, containing 962 names, among which were important state officials, some important politicians and a number of military officers, including the heads of the three Italian secret services. Future Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was on the list, although he had not yet entered politics. He was then known as the founder and owner of ""Canale 5"" TV channel, and was listed as a member of P2.

A Parliamentary Commission, directed by Tina Anselmi (of the Christian Democratic party), found no evidence of crimes, but in 1981 the Italian parliament passed a law banning secret associations in Italy. Gelli was expelled from GOI freemasonry on October 31, 1981, and the P2 scandal provoked the fall of Arnaldo Forlani's cabinet in June 1981.

The P2 lodge had some form of power in Italy, given the public prominence of its members, and many observers still consider it to be extremely strong. Several famous people in Italy today (starting with the top TV anchor-man Maurizio Costanzo) were affiliated with P2. Among these Michele Sindona, a banker with clear connections to the Mafia, has been clearly associated with P2. In 1972, Sindona purchased a controlling interest in Long Island's Franklin National Bank. Two years later, the bank collapsed. Convicted in 1980 in the USA, ""mysterious Michele"" was extradited to Italy. Two years later, he was poisoned in his cell while serving a life sentence. The P2 membership list was authenticated, with a few exceptions, by a 1984 parliamentary report.
On the run, Gelli escaped to Switzerland where he was arrested on September 13, 1982 while trying to withdraw tens of millions of dollars in Geneva.[17] Detained in the modern Champ-Dollon Prison near Geneva, he managed to escape and then fled to South America for four years. In 1984 Jorge Vargas, the secretary general of the Unión Nacionalista de Chile (UNACH, Nationalist Union of Chile, a short-lived National Socialist party) and a former member of the Movimiento Revolucionario Nacional Sindicalista (National-Syndicalist Revolutionary Movement), declared to La Tercera de la Hora that Gelli was then in Pinochet's Chile.

Finally, Gelli surrendered in 1987 in Switzerland to investigative judge Jean-Pierre Trembley. He was wanted in connection with the 1982 collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano and on charges of subversive association in connection with the 1980 Bologna railway station bombing, which killed 85 people. He was sentenced to two months in prison in Switzerland, while an Italian court in Florence sentenced him on December 15, 1987, in absentia, to 8 years in prison on charges of financing right-wing terrorist activity in Tuscany in the 1970s. Gelli had already been sentenced in absentia to 14 months in jail by a court in San Remo for illegally exporting money from Italy.
Extradition to Italy and trials

Switzerland eventually agreed to extradite him to Italy, but only on financial charges stemming from the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano. Gelli's extradition in February 1988 required a high-level security apparatus, including 100 sharpshooters, decoy cars, a train, road blocks and two armored cars to transfer him to Italy. In July 1988 he was absolved of charges of subversive association by a Bologna court but was presented with a five-year prison term for slander, having side-tracked the investigation into the 1980 bombing of the Bologna train station. Stipulations connected to his extradition, however, prevented him from serving time. Two years later, an appeal court threw out Gelli's slander conviction.[33] A retrial was ordered in October 1993.
In 1992 Gelli was sentenced to 18 years and six months of prison after being found guilty of fraud concerning the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano in 1982 (a ""black hole"" of $1.4 billion was found). The Vatican bank, Istituto per le Opere di Religione, main share-holder of the Banco Ambrosiano, consequently had a ""black hole"" of $250 million. This sentence was reduced by the Court of Appeal to 12 years. The year 1992 also saw the beginning of the trial of 16 members of the P2 Masonic Lodge, which included charges of conspiracy against the state, espionage, and the revelation of state secrets.  In April 1994 Gelli received a 17-year sentence for divulging state secrets and slandering the investigation, while the court threw out the charge that P2 members conspired against the state; Gelli's sentence was reduced, and he was placed under house arrest two years later.

In April 1998 the Court of Cassation confirmed a 12-year sentence for the Ambrosiano crash. Gelli then disappeared on the eve of being imprisoned, in May 1998, while being under house arrest in his mansion near Arezzo. His disappearance was strongly suspected to be the result of being forewarned. Then, finally, he was arrested in the French Riviera in Cannes. Two motions of no confidence were made by the right-wing opposition (the Northern League and the ex-Christian Democratic splinter groups CDU-CDR), against the Justice Minister, Giovanni Maria Flick, and the Interior Minister, Giorgio Napolitano, stating that Gelli had benefited from accomplices helping him in his escape. They also made reference to secret negotiations which would have allowed him to reappear without going to prison. But the two ministers won the confidence vote.[39] Police found $2M worth of gold ingots in Gelli's villa.

A few years after the Ambrosiano scandal, many suspects pointed toward Gelli with reference to his possible involvement in the murder of the Milanese banker Roberto Calvi, also known as ""God's banker"", who had been jailed in the wake of the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano. On July 19, 2005 Gelli was formally indicted by Roman Magistrates for the murder of Roberto Calvi, along with former Mafia boss Giuseppe Calò (also known as ""Pippo Calò""), businessmen Ernesto Diotallevi and Flavio Carboni, and the latter's girlfriend, Manuela Kleinszig. In his statement before the court Gelli blamed people connected with Calvi's work in financing the Polish Solidarity movement, allegedly on behalf of the Vatican. He was accused of having provoked Calvi's death in order to punish him for having embezzled money owed to him and the Mafia. The Mafia also wanted to prevent Calvi from revealing how the bank had been used for money laundering. Gelli's name, however, was not in the final indictment at the trial that started in October 2005, and the other accused were eventually acquitted due to ""insufficient evidence"", though by the time of these acquittals in June 2007, the prosecutor's office in Rome had opened a second investigation implicating Gelli, among others. In May 2009, the case against Gelli was dropped. According to the magistrate there was insufficient evidence to argue that Gelli had played a role in the planning and execution of the crime. Gelli has been implicated in Aldo Moro's murder, since the Italian chief of intelligence, accused of negligence, was a piduista (P2 member).

Subject: Freedom of Information Act Request: FBI records on Midwest FurFest and Anthrocon

Portal

To Whom It May Concern:

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:

- Any cross-referenced records containing ""Anthrocon"" or ""Midwest FurFest"" or related to the 2014 chlorine gas incident at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Rosemont, Illinois, including central records and records from the Chicago and Pittsburgh regional field offices.

To assist in searching, the 2014 Midwest FurFest convention was the site of a chlorine gas incident resulting in the evacuation of the hotel. According to news reports, the investigation of the incident included detectives from FBI Chicago's counter-terrorism and weapons of mass destruction unit: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kwxj39/the-mystery-of-who-launched-the-chlorine-gas-attack-at-a-midwest-furry-convention

In 2014, a local Pittsburgh news outlet also reported the FBI was investigating threats against the Anthrocon convention: https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/fbi-investigating-threat-against-furries-town-conv/139889758

For reference, I previously requested records from the central and ELSUR databases containing ""furries"" or regarding the furry subculture (FOIA request #1411086-000), and was told the search had returned no results. If there are any such related field reports or files containing ""furry"" or ""furries"" returned in this search, please include them.

The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.

Sincerely,

CJ Ciaramella - Original Requestor (unaware of repeat request)

He served as campaign manager for the future president's successful runs for the United States Senate in 1950 and for the vice presidency in 1952, and managed the campaigns of other California Republicans. He was active in each of Nixon's two successful runs for the White House in low-profile positions.

After Congress investigated Chotiner in 1956, suspecting he was using his connections to Nixon for influence peddling to benefit his private legal clients, the vice president and his former campaign manager temporarily parted ways. Nixon recalled him to work on his unsuccessful 1962 campaign for Governor of California, and again for his successful 1968 presidential bid. After Nixon was inaugurated in 1969, Chotiner received a political appointment to a government position and, in 1970, became a member of the White House staff.

Coe was known for referring to immigrants as “savages,” alleging a secret Mexican plan to “reconquer” the American Southwest, and claiming that immigration had led to an epidemic of rape and murder.

The California Coalition for Immigration Reform (CCIR) was founded in 1994 by Barbara Coe. Its original purpose was to serve as a co-sponsor for California's Proposition 187, which would have denied social and medical benefits to undocumented immigrants and their children. The initiative passed, but was stalled in the courts for years and effectively killed in 1998 by the then newly elected Democratic Gov. Gray Davis. In 1999, CCIR helped organize a failed effort to recall Davis, who Coe derided as ""Gov. Gray 'Red' Davis.""

CCIR also partnered with Voice of Citizens Together (VCT) chief Glenn Spencer to stage rallies (many of them held on the Fourth of July) that have served as flashpoints in the immigration debate. On Dec. 8, 2001, for instance, the two groups co-sponsored an ""In Defense of America"" rally at the Anaheim, Calif., City Hall, which turned into an open brawl as anti-immigrant hard-liners clashed with Latino rights protesters in the streets.

CCIR made headlines in May 1998 when it paid for a billboard ad on Interstate 10 at the California-Arizona border that read, ""Welcome to California, the Illegal Immigration State,"" and warned visitors, ""Don't let this happen to your state."" Many Latino groups charged that the sign was racist. According to an article in Jinn Magazine, Coe denied that there was any racial motivation behind the billboard but added that she was happy that it incited the anger of ""Hispanic pro-alien race activist[s]."" A month later, the billboard owner removed the advertisement and refunded CCIR its money.

That same year, Coe traveled to Cullman, Ala., to participate in an anti-immigration rally hosted by the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens (in 2005, she would admit to being a member of the group). The event was one of the first of the era where supposedly ""mainstream"" anti-illegal immigration activists collaborated openly with white supremacist operatives. The rally was notable for its anti-Mexican and anti-Asian oratory and the burning of a Mexican flag. Among those attending the Jan. 17, 1998, event were Paul Fromm, a Holocaust denier and associate of neo-Nazis who directs the Canadian Association of Free Expression and founded Citizens for Foreign Aid Reform; William Burchfield, a now deceased Alabama Klan leader who attended without robes or a hood; an unidentified racist skinhead with ""Born to Hate"" tattooed on one arm; Don Crumm of the Alabama chapter of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, a far-right party with deep roots in the extreme anti-abortion movement; and Glenn Spencer, president of CCIR's longtime ally, Voice of Citizens Together.

More recently, CCIR and Coe claimed to expose a secret Mexican conspiracy, called the Plan de Aztlán, to ""reconquer"" the American Southwest. Coe also argued that a shadowy ""New World Order"" is being imposed on America by ""globalists."" In an April 2002 9*1*1 newsletter, CCIR asked: ""Will our sovereignty and the very lives of our children be the price for the 'cheap labor' greed-mongers $ and Third World immigrants' VOTE to keep traitors (who have betrayed their Oath) in office?"" CCIR also produced a DVD, ""The Takeover of America,"" which uses snippets of comments from Latino leaders and others, often taken out of context, as proof of the alleged plot against America.

Charges of racism have long plagued CCIR. According to the Center for New Community, Coe and CCIR's Stan Hess attended a December 1995 conference in Alabama sponsored by the Council of Conservative Citizen (CCC), a group which has described blacks as a ""retrograde species of humanity."" In November 2005, Coe told the Denver Post that she spoke to and belonged to the CCC.

CCIR’s influence and activism declined throughout the late 2000’s and slowed dramatically following the death of Coe in 2013. In 2014, the group hosted Tom Sunic, director of the white nationalist American Freedom Party at a meeting in Garden Grove, where Sunic spoke on “The illusions of Multiracial and Multicultural Society: The Rising Tide of Immigrant Muslim Communitarianism in Europe.”

After Coe’s death, CCIR rebranded, changing its name to the National Coalition for Immigration Reform (NCIR). Despite the rebrand, its activists continue to embrace the group’s nativist legacy. In a 2014 interview with the Orange Country Register, Elaine Proko stated, ""We feel like strangers in our own country.""

Formed in 2005 by longtime activist Kevin Strom, National Vanguard was a breakaway group from the neo-Nazi National Alliance, the most dominant neo-Nazi group from the 1970s until 2002, when its founder died. National Vanguard was increasing its membership and its prestige in white supremacist circles before the arrest and imprisonment of its leader, Kevin Strom, in 2007 for child pornography and witness tampering, after which the group fell apart.

National Vanguard (NV) was the creation of Kevin Alfred Strom, a 20-year veteran of the white supremacist movement. Strom had long played a key but subservient role to William Pierce, founder of the National Alliance — until recently the most important neo-Nazi group in the country — and then to Erich Gliebe, who was anointed over Strom as Pierce's successor. The elevation of Gliebe came even though it was Strom, not Gliebe, who had created and hosted the Alliance's well-known weekly radio show, ""American Dissident Voices""; Strom who convinced Pierce to venture into the white power music business; and Strom who edited the Alliance's flagship publication, National Vanguard, in his role as the group's second in-house ""intellectual,"" after Pierce. 

In the spring of 2005, Strom and other disgruntled Alliance principals were summarily expelled from that group after they tried but failed to overthrow or curtail the power of the Alliance's current leaders. Almost immediately after he was ejected, Strom formed National Vanguard, lifting the name from the Alliance magazine he had edited for years and taking hundreds of other Alliance members with him. The Alliance's old Tampa, Fla., unit, which converted en masse into an NV chapter loyal to Strom, organized a Summer Solstice Festival that same year. 

In its first three months, NV set up 15 chapters, even as the Alliance's membership rolls continued to decline. Strom received clear support from other movement leaders, including leading white supremacists David Duke and Don Black, operator of the infamous Stormfront.org hate site. NV units from Boston to Denver rented billboards and bombarded Internet message boards with propaganda, winning both attention and publicity. Disillusioned and angry over Gliebe's perceived failures as a chairman, several Alliance unit coordinators defected to NV with their entire chapters. High-profile former Alliance member April Gaede, whose young twin daughters were then a popular act in white power music, also signed on with Strom. Performing white supremacist folk songs under the name Prussian Blue, Gaede's daughters Lynx and Lamb shared a stage with Strom at the Tampa gathering. 

Though his critics lampooned his supposedly feminine mannerisms by nicknaming him ""Weenie,"" Strom's intellectual persona gave him a veneer of respectability that stood in sharp contrast to the thuggish image of most of the white supremacist world. But then something unexpected — and, for a time, unexplained — happened. In July 2006, Strom abruptly announced he was taking a leave of absence as chief of National Vanguard because of ""family and health matters."" He acknowledged having ""made mistakes, some of them serious ones,"" but didn't elaborate. 

Strom's public woes began on Jan. 4, 2007, when federal agents arrested him near his home in Stanardsville, Va (where he had moved from Charlottesville after separating from his wife, Elisha). He was charged with possessing and receiving child pornography, enticing a minor to perform sex acts and intimidating a witness, sending shock waves through the white supremacist world. In March 2007, facing ubiquitous movement criticism, Strom officially disbanded NV.

Strom ended up facing two separate trials. Charges against Strom for possession of child pornography were separated out for a later trial. In the first trial, held in October, Strom prevailed. U.S. District Judge Norman Moon ruled Strom's numerous legal complaints against his wife did not amount to intimidation. And the judge found that while Strom had followed and anonymously sent many gifts to a 10-year-old girl, he had not actually tried to have sex with her. The judge did note that there was ""overwhelming evidence he was sexually drawn to this child.""

In January 2008, Strom faced a second federal trial on possession of child pornography. Strom struck a deal at a plea hearing with prosecutors in which he pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography. In exchange, multiple counts of receiving child porn were dismissed. During his sentencing on April 21, 2008, Strom claimed the child porn came from an online forum he'd visited and that he had not intentionally downloaded it onto his computer. Strom, who had already served more than one year in prison, asked Judge Moon not to give him further time. ""Mr. Strom, you pled guilty to charges that now you're saying you're innocent [of],"" Moon responded. ""I prefer people plead not guilty than put it on me."" Moon, who called Strom's guilty plea ""extremely serious,"" then sentenced him to 23 months in jail. 

National Vanguard fell apart in late March of 2007, apparently unable to survive the imprisonment and public humiliation of Strom. But as early as September of 2006, four months before Strom's arrest, rebellious elements within NV already had attempted to move the headquarters to Sacramento, Calif. Early in 2007, the state of Virginia liquidated the group's legal parent, making it impossible, according to the Sacramento insurrectionists, to access the group's bank accounts. 

A March 2007 posting on the NV website proposed that readers ""interested in pro-European-American activism"" sign on with NV's replacement, European Americans United (EAU), which supports white separatism and is against ""Third World immigration,"" and that they keep abreast of the news at the group's Western Voices World News site. To avoid the kind of collapse that happened to NV, a board of directors, instead of one person, runs EAU, and all directors must prove they have no criminal background. Paeans to neo-Nazi leaders like the late National Alliance founder William Pierce are to be replaced with calls to white nationalism in hopes of building a broader movement. 

Strom was freed from prison in Sept. 2008 and has not returned to the movement.

Since its founding in 1930, the Nation of Islam (NOI) has grown into one of the wealthiest and best-known organizations in black America, offering numerous programs and events designed to uplift African Americans. Nonetheless, its bizarre theology of innate black superiority over whites — a belief system vehemently and consistently rejected by mainstream Muslims — and the deeply racist, anti-Semitic and anti-gay rhetoric of its leaders, including top minister Louis Farrakhan, have earned the NOI a prominent position in the ranks of organized hate.

For what would become one of the largest and best-organized groups in the history of black America, the Nation of Islam (NOI) had a relatively obscure beginning. Founded by a mysterious clothing salesman in the ghettoes of Detroit in 1930, NOI was considered an insignificant, if highly media-worthy, ""‘voodoo sect"" throughout much of the 1930s and 1940s. 

Founder Wallace D. Fard (alternately, Farad Muhammad) and his ""messenger"" and successor Elijah Muhammad preached a hybrid creed with its own myths and doctrines. These held that over 6,000 years ago, the black race lived in a paradise on earth that was destroyed by the evil wizard Yacub, who created the white ""devil"" through a scientific process called ""grafting."" Fard and his disciple preached of a coming apocalyptic overthrow of white domination, insisting that the dominion of evil was to end with God's appearance on earth in the person of Fard. Following this, NOI predicts an epic struggle in which the Nation of Islam will play a key role in preparing and educating the Original People, who ruled the earth in peace and prosperity until Yacub's ""blue-eyed devils"" came along to gum things up. The Nation of Islam teaches that intermarriage or race mixing should be prohibited. This is point 10 of the official platform, ""What the Muslims Want"" published 1965.

NOI's connection to Islam is through its founder Fard. NOI believes, like other Muslims, that there is no other God but Allah, but they redefine ""Allah"" by saying that he ""came in the person of W. D. Fard.""

Despite the initial group's small size and early setbacks, Fard and his disciple laid the groundwork for what the group was to become in the 1950s and 1960s. From the start, NOI was tightly organized, a fact most clearly seen in its creation of the elite ""Fruit of Islam,"" a group envisioned by Fard as a paramilitary wing to defend NOI against police attacks. In the 1940s, ""messenger"" Elijah Muhammad also began constructing what would later be considered the Nation's ""empire,"" purchasing the group's first bit of Michigan farmland in 1945 and founding businesses and educational ventures in several states that a decade later were valued in the millions.

NOI's real boom came during the 1950s, however, when the advent of the civil rights movement and the violent reactions it provoked converged to make NOI's depiction of the ""white devil"" pertinent to a much larger sector of black America. New members, including Malcolm X and heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali (Cassius Clay before joining NOI), added visibility to the group and, in the case of the former, contributed directly to a meteoric membership increase. 

Appointed to the prestigious leadership of Harlem's Temple No. 7 in New York City just two years after his 1952 release from prison, Malcolm X was wildly popular and his years as a prominent member of NOI (1952-1964) saw membership skyrocket from around 400 to between 100,000 and 300,000. But the Nation's vituperative language and its advocacy of self-defense in place of nonviolence alienated it from mainstream civil rights groups. By 1959, Martin Luther King was warning of ""a hate group arising in our midst that would preach the doctrine of black supremacy.""

Nevertheless, the mid-1960s saw a second membership surge at NOI as a new and more militant generation of black leaders began focusing on the residual racial problems of the North. As urban riots rocked the nation, NOI's message that black elevation could only come through a radical separation from the structures of white oppression continued to resonate for many. Although NOI remained frustratingly conservative in many ways (indeed, Malcolm X ""liberated"" himself from this conservatism in 1964), its radical rhetoric continued to attract recruits.

Following Malcolm X's 1964 split from his erstwhile mentor, Elijah Muhammad, a rising star in the Nation was appointed to replace him at Temple No. 7. Louis Farrakhan had been working as a cabaret singer until he met Malcolm X and joined NOI in 1955. Ascending rapidly through the ranks, he had proved to be a superb speaker and organizer, managing to win over the congregation left behind by his charismatic predecessor. He faced a firestorm after Malcolm X's 1965 assassination, for which many blamed NOI. Talmadge Hayer, an NOI member, was arrested on the scene. Eyewitnesses identified two more suspects, Norman 3X Butler and Thomas 15X Johnson, also members of NOI. All three were charged in the case. At first Hayer denied involvement, but during the trial he confessed to having fired shots at Malcolm X (In the months before he was murdered, meanwhile, Malcolm X had a complete change of heart, denouncing the ""sickness and madness"" of the NOI's racism and turning to Sunni Islam.) Hayer testified that Butler and Johnson were not present and were not involved in the assassination, but he declined to name the men who had joined him in the shooting. All three men were convicted. Butler, now known as Muhammad Abdul Aziz, was paroled in 1985. He became the head of the Nation of Islam's Harlem mosque in New York in 1998.

Farrakhan weathered the storm of Malcolm X's assassination and managed to create a powerful base within the Nation, ascending to the position of national spokesman in 1967. 

When Elijah Muhammad died in 1975, Farrakhan initially remained faithful to his son, Wallace Deen Muhammad (later Imam Warithuddin Muhammad) who succeeded him. But the younger Muhammad's dismantling of the Nation's material empire and his attempts to bring NOI into the fold of mainstream Islam ultimately alienated Farrakhan. In 1977, a rebellious Farrakhan, backed by a powerful enough base to pull it off, rejected the younger Muhammad and declared the creation of a ""resurrected"" NOI based on the original ideology of Elijah Muhammad. 

At the head of the new NOI, Farrakhan successfully rebuilt an empire. Aside from continuing NOI's earlier educational and training programs, the reconstituted Nation embarked on economic self-sufficiency programs, creating bakeries, restaurants, fish markets and even a line of hair and skin care products. NOI also took on a series of initiatives including providing security for housing projects, reaching out to prison inmates, and creating programs for those suffering from HIV and AIDS. Most recently, it has worked to reach out to the world of hip-hop, engaging various artists in an attempt to entice to a younger generation of potential NOI members. 

NOI's efforts are tainted, however, by a long history of racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric that escalated dramatically with Farrakhan's coup. Even prior to Farrakhan, NOI's characterization of whites as ""devils"" was unwavering. The seeds of anti-Semitism were deeply rooted in the organization, with Elijah Muhammad preaching early on about greedy Jews who turned Jesus Christ in to the authorities. Even during the early days of the civil rights movement, a period of collaboration between progressive Jews and blacks, Malcolm X had denounced Jews in the leadership of the NAACP and linked their presence there to the group's non-militant stance.

During the early 1980s, the deeply bigoted language for which NOI is infamous for today became daily fare, exacerbated by the charged atmosphere surrounding Jesse Jackson's 1984 presidential bid. Farrakhan made several of his most infamous remarks during the campaign, including calling Hitler ""a very great man"" and Judaism a ""dirty religion"" (some say he actually termed it a ""gutter religion""). While these and other remarks ultimately spurred Jackson to publicly disavow Farrakhan, the controversy actually increased the NOI leader's visibility and appeal to many African Americans angered at the attacks on him.

Farrakhan's racist venom continued, to the point that he was banned in 1986 from entering the United Kingdom, where officials cited concerns for racial harmony. He frequently reiterated the ""dirty religion"" theme along with references to the ""so-called Jew"" (arguing that the ""true"" Jews were black North Africans) and constant accusations of secret Jewish control of financial and political institutions. One of the most baseless attacks came in the form of a 1991 ""study"" ordered up by Farrakhan and written by NOI's ""Historical Research Department."" Entitled The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews, the book uses isolated examples of Jewish merchants' involvement in the purchase and ownership of slaves to place the onus of the slavery industry squarely on Jewish shoulders — a historical falsehood,

While Jews remain the primary target of Farrakhan's vitriol, he is also well known for bashing gay men and lesbians, Catholics and, of course, the white devils, whom he calls ""potential humans ... [who] haven't evolved yet."" All of this has helped make him attractive to certain white supremacist groups who agree that the races must be separated. In its turn, NOI has come to view white supremacists as people who at least understand NOI's program and could therefore become allies.

In one early instance, American Nazi Party boss George Lincoln Rockwell appeared at NOI's 1962 Saviour's Day Convention, christening Elijah Muhammad the Hitler of blacks. In another, Malcolm X, on departing from NOI in 1964, spoke of an Atlanta meeting (later corroborated by FBI records) between NOI and the Klan in an attempt to establish mutual working conditions. In more recent years, a yearning for racial separation has brought NOI other strange bedfellows. During the Jesse Jackson campaign, NOI was discovered by white ""Third Positionists"" (who espouse, among other things, radical racial separatism) in the extreme-right British National Front, some of whom developed friendly relationships with NOI officials in the late 1980s before suffering a backlash from the rank and file who could not understand their leadership's cozy ties to American ""niggers."" Similarly, American neo-Nazi and White Aryan Resistance founder Tom Metzger has praised NOI's anti-Semitic rhetoric and has even donated a symbolic amount of money to the Nation.

Just as disturbing has been Farrakhan's willingness to tie himself to authoritarian and, in many cases, violently repressive foreign leaders for the sake of furthering black and Islamic administrations worldwide. These include Libyan dictator Muammar Ghadaffi, Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe, and the now deceased General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan and Ugandan despot Idi Amin.

During the mid-1990s, it seemed that Farrakhan was trying to moderate his message, reaching out to the Jewish community groups and more mainstream black organizations. But any such effort was thwarted by his own continued anti-Semitic remarks and those of his officers. In 1993, for instance, an attempt at reconciliation with the Congressional Black Caucus failed after the Anti-Defamation League published an article detailing a wildly incendiary speech by top NOI official Khalid Muhammad at New Jersey's Kean College in November of that year in which he violently bashed Jews, Catholics, LGBT people and whites. Similarly, although many local chapters of the NAACP endorsed the Million Man March where Farrakhan was the keynote speaker, the national organization refused to participate in any way.

More recently, Farrakhan has established a close relationship with the New Black Panther Party, which was led by former deputy Khalid Muhammad (who left NOI after his more volatile remarks were widely publicized) until Muhammad's death in 2001. Openly racist and violently anti-Semitic, the New Panthers have been denounced by leading members of the original Black Panther Party — men like Bobby Seale — as ""a racist hate group."" But that didn't stop Farrakhan from inviting current New Panther boss Malik Zulu Shabazz to co-convene NOI's 2005 Millions More March, marking the 10th anniversary of the Million Man March.

Farrakhan has been suffering from prostate cancer, and seems to be weakening as the years pass. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that NOI's legacy of racism will die with him. This is particularly true given that to this day, NOI members continue to promote racist and anti-Semitic ideas. A case in point is Ashahed Muhammad, a prominent NOI member and author of Synagogue of Satan, a book advertised on NOI's website that alleges, once again, a Jewish conspiracy to control the federal government. Muhammad runs the Truth Establishment Institute website, which, alongside Synagogue of Satan and The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews, offers works by the likes of Mark Weber, a former member of the neo-Nazi National Alliance and the long-time leader of the Holocaust-denying Institute for Historical Review. As a younger generation of NOI leaders rises to prominence, it is thus decidedly unclear whether NOI will be able to shed its legacy of hate.

EmmaBest,Oath Keepers,Completed,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/oath-keepers-31242/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning the Oath Keepers, which claims tens of thousands of present and former law enforcement officials and military veterans as members, is one of the largest radical antigovernment groups in the U.S. today. While it claims only to be defending the Constitution, the entire organization is based on a set of baseless conspiracy theories about the federal government working to destroy the liberties of Americans.

The Oath Keepers was formed in 2009 by Yale Law School graduate and former U.S. Army paratrooper Stewart Rhodes in the direct aftermath of the election of the nation’s first black president. Today, it is one of the largest radical antigovernment organizations in the United States. By 2016, the group was claiming an improbable 30,000 members who were said to be mostly current and former military, law enforcement and emergency first responders.

The core idea of the Oath Keepers is that its members vow to forever support the oaths they took on joining law enforcement or the military to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” As a practical matter, what that means to the group is suggested most plainly by its list of the 10 “Orders We Will Not Obey” — a compendium of much-feared but entirely imaginary threats from the government, including forcing Americans into detention camps, imposing martial law, and disarming all civilians. Those supposed threats are all key to the central conspiracy theory of the antigovernment “Patriot” movement of which the Oath Keepers is a part. Basically, Patriots believe that the government will at any moment impose martial law, probably with the aid of foreign or United Nations troops; that all guns belonging to normal citizens will then be seized; that resisters will be thrown into concentration camps; and that, in the end, America will be forced into a one-world socialist government, “The New World Order.”

In 2010, Rhodes and his Oath Keepers deployed in public for the first time, traveling to Quartzsite, a small Arizona town, to defend local residents who were ejected after refusing to leave a town council meeting on alleged government corruption. The group’s website called Quartzsite a “pivot point” for Americans to finally see the looming danger of the “New World Order.” In the end, the Oath Keepers got a lot of headlines, but accomplished virtually nothing — other than Arizona officials censuring Rhodes for practicing law in that state without a license by writing letters threatening a lawsuit on behalf of the ejected residents. He was fined $600.

In a more serious episode, Daniel Knight Hayden, an Oklahoma man who identified himself as an Oath Keeper, was indicted by a federal grand jury after tweeting messages threatening a violent attack on Oklahoma state government officials on April 15, which is Tax Day. Hayden was sentenced to eight months in prison in 2010. Another troubling example: Matthew Fairfield, a suburban Cleveland man described by prosecutors as the president of a local Oath Keepers chapter, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for storing bombs at his and a friend’s home and for obstructing justice. After Fairfield’s 2011 sentencing, a county prosecutor said it would be fair to call the local Oath Keepers leader a potential terrorist.

In a widely publicized case, another Oath Keeper was sentenced to 30 years in prison for raping his own 7-year-old daughter. After failing to appear for trial in 2010, Charles Dyer, an ex-Marine, led police on a multi-state chase and began issuing threats against law enforcement, warning that they’d better not catch up to him. Although Dyer had spoken on behalf of the Oath Keepers and online videos identified himself as the group’s liaison to the Marines, Rhodes claimed after the charges were brought that Dyer wasn’t actually a part of his organization.

That wasn’t the only time that the Oath Keepers has sought to put distance between itself and members who bring it bad press. In 2015, the group censured prominent member Jon Ritzheimer after Ritzheimer suggested that he planned to travel from Arizona to carry out a citizen’s arrest of U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D. Mich.). Ritzheimer was angry that Stabenow had signed an agreement between the U.S. and Iran on limiting the Iranians’ nuclear program. Ritzheimer also said he would go on to arrest all of those involved in making the deal, including President Obama.

In 2013, four years after its formation, the Oath Keepers announced the planned formation of “Citizen Preservation” militias, which are meant to defend Americans against the New World Order. The real goal of these militias, which have since been renamed Civilian Preparedness Teams, is to prey upon the fears and concerns of local communities and revitalize the American militia movement, all under the guise of neighborhood watch and self-sufficiency. “We want to see a restoration of the militia in this country,” Rhodes explained on a “God and Guns” podcast. “We think a good first step is to have the veterans stand up in every community and go help form and train neighborhood watches, to get the people to take back into their own hands their own personal self-defense and security.”

In April 2014, Rhodes and several fellow Oath Keepers traveled to the Nevada ranch of Cliven Bundy, answering a nationwide call Bundy had made asking militiamen to join him in standing up to federal officials seeking to seize his cattle because he had refused to pay federal grazing fees for some 20 years. But the Oath Keepers made fools of themselves that day, excitedly telling Bundy’s rag-tag army that they had received “intel” that President Obama was about to attack the Bundy ranch with drones. The Oath Keepers fled, leaving Bundy’s other supporters to mock them as cowards and delusional paranoids. Because the government ultimately stood down in the face of armed threats from Bundy’s defenders, the standoff wound up being a highlight of the radical right — but one that the Oath Keepers got no glory from.

Four months later, white, heavily armed Oath Keepers showed up in Ferguson, Mo., during the racial unrest that followed the shooting death of Michael Brown, a black man, by a police officer. The heavily armed group members were seen on rooftops patrolling in what they said was an effort to protect businesses from rioters. Though they later claimed to have protected one black woman’s business, it seemed clear that they were really there to protect white businesses against black protesters.

The Oath Keepers also has been involved in a number of confrontations between the federal government and militants in disputes over public lands.

In 2015, an Oregon chapter of the Oath Keepers acted in support Rick Barclay and George Backes, two Oregon gold miners running an illegal mining site. The miners received a “letter of noncompliance” from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) telling them they either needed to clear out of the mine within 60 days or file an appeal of the noncompliance ruling. Instead, the miners appealed to the Oath Keepers, and what followed was an Oath Keepers nationwide call to action, put out by Joseph Rice of the Josephine County Oath Keepers, to help the miners fight the BLM. Operation Gold Rush, as it was called, was dubbed a “security operation” because owner Rick Barclay insisted that the BLM was notorious for burning down miners’ cabins in the backwoods, and he said later that they would have destroyed his mine if he had not called for help. BLM spokesman Jim Whittington told the Southern Poverty Law Center that these accusations were groundless.

Regardless, according to the local Oath Keepers chapter, at least 700 supporters responded to the call to action. Josephine County Sheriff Dave Daniel told High Country News that he wasn’t worried about conflict between law enforcement and the miners. But the militia, who effectively turned the mountains around the mine into a heavily armed patrol base, was a different story. “I was [concerned] in that there were militia, Three Percenters and Oath Keepers from around the country that had come in and were potentially unpredictable. [A group spokesman] will tell you that everyone was vetted properly. I have a difficult time believing that 100 percent of the people were cleared or were 100 percent controllable.”

Ultimately, there was no standoff. James Roberts, an administrative law judge with the Interior Board of Land Appeals, issued a stay which stated that the miners were allowed to operate the mine while the board deliberated. This was seen as yet another victory for the Oath Keepers and the antigovernment movement.

Also in 2015, Oath Keepers in Montana put out another call to action, summoning members to help another local miner fight the government– even though the Forest Service had been working with the miner for some time to resolve the issue. “Obviously, we’re not in a confrontation,” David Smith, regional spokesman for the Forest Service, told the Southern Poverty Law Center. “It’s not the people who are there I’m worried about – it’s the ones from the fringe who want to join in. And I’m worried about the safety of the people up there. We don’t want to see things escalate, especially over an issue that we have been working all along in a very cooperative way to resolve.” Ultimately, again, no real standoff developed.

But that wasn’t the case in early 2016, when members of the same Bundy family that was at the center of the 2014 Nevada standoff got interested in another conflict with the federal government, this one in Harney County, Ore.

The cause that drew the Bundys — Ammon and Ryan Bundy, sons of Cliven — was two ranchers near Burns, Ore., who had recently been ordered back to prison for arson of public lands after an appeals court decided they had initially been sentenced to terms that were too short by law. The Bundys and other sympathizers tried to get Dwight Hammond, 73, and his son, Steven Hammond, 46, on their side, denouncing both the Hammonds’ resentencing and the management of public lands by federal agencies. But the Hammonds said they were planning on reporting to prison, did not want their help, and asked them to return to Nevada. Despite this, the Bundys and a number of other heavily armed militants decided suddenly to break away from a pro-Hammond rally in Oregon and occupy the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, a famous birding location. The standoff with federal and other law enforcement agencies that followed lasted 41 days. It was broken up only after officials arrested the Bundys and others at a roadblock near the refuge.

The Oath Keepers did denounce the Malheur occupation — not so much because it was an illegal armed invasion but, as Rhodes wrote, “specifically because it is not being done with the consent of the locals or at their request, without the request of the Hammond family . . . and because it is not in direct defense of anyone.” Another group official, associate editor Brandon Smith, said he opposed the occupation because “starting this fight from a much stronger position is more than possible.”

While criticizing the occupation, the Oath Keepers did take part in a coalition of militias in the Pacific Northwest called the Pacific Patriots Network, which served as a “buffer” between the occupiers and government forces. The Pacific Patriots Network also includes antigovernment extremist groups aligned with the Three Percenters, and the Oath Keepers’ contingent is the very same chapter that took part in Operation Gold Rush in Oregon in 2015.

During the 2016 presidential election, the Oath Keepers were at it again, with Rhodes announcing “Operation Sabot 2016” as a method to prevent the election from being stolen from Donald Trump, something the candidate had predicted numerous times. “[W]e call on you to form up incognito intelligence gathering and crime spotting teams,” Rhodes said. “And go out into public on election day, dressed to blend in with the public … with video, still camera, and notepad in hand, to look for and document suspected criminal vote fraud or intimidation activities.” And he made clear that it was the Democrats, not the Republicans, who might steal the election.  “[W]e are, indeed, most concerned about expected attempts at voter fraud by leftists,” Rhodes said. “But we will spot, document, and report any apparent attempt at vote fraud or voter intimidation … as is our duty.”

Between the years 1946 and 1956, Gebhard was a close colleague to sex researcher Alfred Kinsey.  It was acknowledged in Gebhard's New York Times obituary that Kinsey was in fact his mentor and that Gebhard was fascinated when Kinsey first met him and revealed to him that the men's room at Grand Central Terminal in New York City was a frequent site for gay cruising. He joined the Department of Anthropology of Indiana University in 1947, and retired in 1986.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.",1366621-000,False,1593,238,,,0.00,2017-02-04 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-06,2020-10-21 04:56:00+00:00,ralph-abernathy-32883

If for any reason any portion of this request is denied, please provide written notice of the records that were withheld, and the specific legal justification for the denial. Please also provide the name and address of the officer(s) or body to which my appeal should be directed.

I also hereby request a waiver of both search and duplication fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(1l) and (a)(4XA)(iii). MuckRock is entitled to a waiver of search fees under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(11) because MuckRock is a member of the news media. cf. National Security Archive v. Department of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1387 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (defining news media within FOIA context).

MuckRock is a registered non-profit, collaborative news site that has recognized as been recognized by the Sunlight Foundation, The Freedom of the Press Foundation,the Global Investigative Journalism Network (all of which employ FOIA in their reporting).

MuckRock via it's website (muckrock.com) regularly obtains and publishes information about the operations and activities of government through FOIA and uses its editorial staff and contributors to turn this information into distinct works, and publishes and disseminates these works to the public. As it intends to do likewise with the records it receives in response to this inquest.

MuckRock also is entitled to a complete waiver of both search fees and duplication fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Under this provision:

Records shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees established under clause (ii) if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4XAXiii).

In addition, if records are not produced within twenty (20) business days. Muckrock is entitled to a complete waiver of search and duplication fees under Section 6(b) of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, which amended FOR at 5 U.S.C. § (a)(4)(A)(viii).

MuckRock is a 501(c)(3), not-for-profit, educational organization, and, by definition, it has no commercial purpose. MuckRock exists to educate the public about the operations and activities of government, as well as to increase public understanding about the importance of ethics and the rule of law in government.

The particular records requested herein are sought as part of MuckRock's ongoing efforts to document the operations and activities of of government agencies and to educate the public about these operations and activities. Once MuckRock obtains the requested records, it intends to analyze them and disseminate the results of its analysis.

There is a clear public interest case in having these files released therefore I request fees be waived for the following reasons:

1) The questions raised about the government's motivations, integrity and judgment on this issue.

2) Any wrongdoing by the subject(s) in question, the government and/or other federal officials the materials may expose.

3) The subject is of ""widespread and exceptional media interest"" the widespread public interest and reporting on this case.

Its April 1966 cover article concerned the Michigan State University Group, a technical assistance program in South Vietnam that Ramparts claimed was a front for CIA covert operations. Beginning that year, American authorities began investigating the magazine's funding, suspecting Soviet financial connections. In February 1967, Ramparts revealed links between the CIA and the National Student Association, raising concerns about CIA involvement in domestic issues. The CIA knew about the revelations in advance, and tried their best to limit the extent of the scandal.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

If for any reason any portion of this request is denied, please provide written notice of the records that were withheld, and the specific legal justification for the denial. Please also provide the name and address of the officer(s) or body to which my appeal should be directed.

I also hereby request a waiver of both search and duplication fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(1l) and (a)(4XA)(iii). MuckRock is entitled to a waiver of search fees under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(11) because MuckRock is a member of the news media. cf. National Security Archive v. Department of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1387 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (defining news media within FOIA context).

MuckRock is a registered non-profit, collaborative news site that has recognized as been recognized by the Sunlight Foundation, The Freedom of the Press Foundation,the Global Investigative Journalism Network (all of which employ FOIA in their reporting).

MuckRock via it's website (muckrock.com) regularly obtains and publishes information about the operations and activities of government through FOIA and uses its editorial staff and contributors to turn this information into distinct works, and publishes and disseminates these works to the public. As it intends to do likewise with the records it receives in response to this inquest.

MuckRock also is entitled to a complete waiver of both search fees and duplication fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Under this provision:

Records shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees established under clause (ii) if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4XAXiii).

In addition, if records are not produced within twenty (20) business days. Muckrock is entitled to a complete waiver of search and duplication fees under Section 6(b) of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, which amended FOR at 5 U.S.C. § (a)(4)(A)(viii).

MuckRock is a 501(c)(3), not-for-profit, educational organization, and, by definition, it has no commercial purpose. MuckRock exists to educate the public about the operations and activities of government, as well as to increase public understanding about the importance of ethics and the rule of law in government.

The particular records requested herein are sought as part of MuckRock's ongoing efforts to document the operations and activities of of government agencies and to educate the public about these operations and activities. Once MuckRock obtains the requested records, it intends to analyze them and disseminate the results of its analysis.

There is a clear public interest case in having these files released therefore I request fees be waived for the following reasons:

1) The questions raised about the government's motivations, integrity and judgment on this issue.

2) Any wrongdoing by the subject(s) in question, the government and/or other federal officials the materials may expose.

3) The subject is of ""widespread and exceptional media interest"" the widespread public interest and reporting on this case.

4) As a journalist and member of muckrock.com, I am engaged in reporting and disseminating information to the public, free of charge.

The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.

In addition to standard practices, please conduct:

- Searches of the Electronic Case File System (ECF)
- Searches of Special Agent in Charge (SAC) safes
- Searches of SENTINEL
- Searches of Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices

I want **ALL** records identifiable with this request, even though reports based on those records may have been sent to department headquarters or other department offices, and even though there may be duplication between sets of files. Please produce all records with their administrative markings intact, and all reports, memos, and documents to include any and all administrative pages. In any responsive material, please black out rather than white out or cut out material.

I request the administrative case file (including search slips and processing notes, i.e email correspondence and text messages) for this request.

This part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part.

BACKGROUND

Wallace ""Mad Bear"" Anderson (November 9, 1927 – December 10, 1985) was a Tuscarora Native American activist predominantly active in the 1950s who became a spokesman for Native American Sovereignty.

As a child, Anderson received the nickname ""Mad Bear"" from his grandmother due to his temper. As a young man, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy, serving during World War II in Okinawa, and later in Korea during the Korean War. Anderson became an activist for Native American Rights after being rejected for a loan under the GI Bill to build a house on the Tuscarora reservation.

Anderson led protests against Iroquois payment of New York State income taxes in 1957. Several hundred Akwesasne Mohawks marched to the Massena, New York courthouse to burn court summons that were issued for unpaid taxes.

The Power Authority of the State of New York seized Tuscarora Reservation land to build a reservoir to flood the land. Anderson was a key figure in the protest against the Tuscarora Reservoir, blocking surveyors from entering the reservation and deflating tires of workers, as well as lying in the road to block trucks. Despite the protest efforts, the U.S. Supreme Court eventually ruled that the taking of the land was legal and the reservoir was built. This lead to Federal Power Commission v. Tuscarora Indian Nation.

In March 1959, Anderson helped to lead a revolt and declaration of sovereignty at the Six Nations Reserve in Brantford, Ontario, the borough founded by Joseph Brant. Following this declaration, twelve Royal Canadian Mounted Police entered the reserve's council house, but the Iroquois forced them out.  
  
BACKGROUND    
  
Rose City Antifa (RCA) is an antifascist group founded 2007 in Portland, Oregon. A leftist group, it is the oldest known active antifa group in the United States. While anti-fascist activism in the United States dates back to the 1980s, Rose City Antifa is the first to adopt the abbreviated moniker ""antifa"". Since 2016, Rose City Antifa is one of the nine chapters of Torch Network coalition.
  
Rose City Antifa was formed in 2007 to coordinate opposition to a music festival that was planned to be held near Portland by neo-Nazis associated with White Aryan Resistance.

According to one of its leaders, the group concentrates on ""outing"" people whom they believe to be neo-Nazis. According to Alexander Reid Ross, the author of the book Against the Fascist Creep, Rose City Antifa grew out of the group Anti-Racist Action (ARA) which first appeared in 1987. Through Rose City Antifa, ""the European and American models were sort of synthesized and the current model of Antifa in the US was developed"".

Between 2007 and 2013, Rose City Antifa was part of Anti-Racist Action. Since 2016, Rose City Antifa has been part of the Torch Network.

Rose City Antifa has campaigned against the white separatist organization Volksfront, the band Death in June, the Ku Klux Klan and the American Renaissance website. The group has organized opposition to Patriot Prayer rallies in Portland. Rose City Antifa clashed with law enforcement officials and supporters of the presidency of Donald Trump following the 2016 United States presidential election. Before a June 2017 rally, the group released a statement saying they would be ""unapologetic"" over the use of ""physical militancy"". In August 2020 RCA and Popular Mobilization organized a counter-protest against the Proud Boys in Portland. In September 2020, RCA published a photograph of Patrior Prayer founder Joey Gibson with Chester Doles, a former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. RCA argues that the Portland Police Bureau tolerates crimes by far-right groups while suppressing protests by left-wing groups.

The group has sought to counter the argument that anti-fascist activism infringes on the freedom of speech of the far right. They have argued that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution ""protect[s] citizens from state interference, not from criticism by the public ... we do not have a powerful state apparatus at our disposal ... therefore the concepts of 'censorship' and 'free speech rights' are not in any reasonable way applicable."" Rose City Antifa also argues that anti-fascism does not target the speech of the far right, but rather targets its political organizing.",1491973-000,False,,77,,,0.00,,2021-04-06,2021-03-31 17:55:44.104522+00:00,rose-city-antifa-109487

Please reopen any and all FOIA requests that were closed because this payment was overlooked and please begin to process any requests that were not opened because of this fee. Due to a large quantity of records being reviewed at my office, this request for payment was missed and should not be interpreted as any willful avoidance of paying fees.

The Ramones were an American punk rock band that formed in the New York City neighborhood of Forest Hills, Queens in 1974. They are often cited as the first true punk rock group. Despite achieving only limited commercial success initially, the band was highly influential in the United States, Brazil, and most of South America, as well as Europe, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, and Belgium. 

All of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname ""Ramone"", although none of them were biologically related. They performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years. The band was active from 1974 to 1996.

The Ramones released 14 studio albums:
    - Ramones (1976)

EmmaBest,Traditionalist Workers Party,Completed,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/traditionalist-workers-party-31275/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning Traditionalist Workers Party, which is a white nationalist group that advocates for racially pure nations and communities and blames Jews for many of the world’s problems. Even as it claims to oppose racism, saying every race deserves its own lands and culture, the group is intimately allied with neo-Nazi and other hardline racist organizations that espouse unvarnished white supremacist views.

In 2013, Matthew Heimbach — a young rising star in the white supremacist world who had led the White Student Union at Towson University in Maryland — joined with Matthew Parrott to found a white nationalist group they dubbed the Traditionalist Youth Network (TYN). Featuring a blog and a podcast, the group’s mission was “to provide resources and support to independent groups of high school and college students throughout North America who are learning about the Traditionalist School of thought” — a reference to an ideology that calls for a return to “traditional” values, including the central claim that nations should be racially and culturally homogenous. Heimbach and Parrot went on, in 2015, to create the Traditionalist Workers Party (TWP) as the political wing of the TYN.

The TWP’s goal, according to a platform statement on its website, is this: “While we have candidates for political office and will run campaigns, that work is secondary to our first priority, which is local organizing and advocacy for real-life working families who share our identitarian and traditionalist vision.” (Identitarianism is a closely related ideology that emerged in recent years in Europe.) The group uses the slogan “Local solutions to the globalist problem,” a reference to the idea that globalization, the knitting together of nations and national economies throughout the developed world, is destroying racially homogenous communities and nations.

The TWP/TYN is part and parcel of the American “Neo-Nazi,” an umbrella term for a racist ideology that scorns mainstream conservatism and argues that white people and white culture in America are under threat from the forces of political correctness and multiculturalism. It is also “traditionalist” and “identitarian.”

The group’s version of “traditionalism” has its roots in the “radical traditionalism” espoused by mid-20th century Italian “philosopher” Julius Evola, a fascist thinker who believed that Jews were to blame for the modern materialism and democracy that he thought subverted the natural order of the world. The TWP website includes the group’s definition of traditionalism: “Traditionalism, properly applied, makes us as autonomous and self-governing as possible in relation to the modernist societies that we live in.” It defines traditions as “positive cultural interactions that have existed over a long period of time” and says “those traditions have existed for a long time, because they work. They have formed European-American mores.” The traditionalist ideology sees adherence to those “mores” as the best way to organize society, and argues that a traditionalist lifestyle can successfully supplant the state, since “the family is the natural enemy of the state.”

“Identitarianism” refers to a movement that emerged in recent years in France that advocates for culturally and ethnically homogenous communities and blames liberals for selling out their country. Generation Identitaire, the youth wing of the anti-immigrant Bloc Identitaire movement in France, is known for its racist and xenophobic anti-Muslim stunts, like serving soups containing pork in Muslim neighborhoods. The ideology has its roots in the European New Right, or Nouvelle Droite, founded by French academic Alain de Benoist, who advocated against melting-pot societies and immigration while claiming to oppose biological racism.

The TWP positions itself as being in favor of diversity — what it terms “ethnopluralism.” But what it means by that word is a diversity of nations around the globe that are each racially and culturally homogenous. In a section on its website defining the term, it says that “ethnopluralists argue that the liberal multiculturalism is false, as it promotes a melting pot which leads to the disappearance of ethnicities, cultures or races through miscegenation and therefore is in fact monoculturalism.” TWP is against racial intermarriage, no surprise given its platform statements.

The “Folk” section of the TWP platform puts the group’s white nationalist views, and associated anti-immigrant vitriol, clearly on display. It says that communities should be able to determine their own “religious and ethnic character” without government interference, that American 14th Amendment birthright citizenship should be revoked, and that the borders should be secured with National Guard troops. One platform plank, “Stop Discrimination Against Whites,” claims that “our government is stacking the deck against White families,” and says that TWP “opposes all racial quotas in education, hiring, and government contracts.”

Heimbach himself is an Orthodox Christian, and the TWP has a clear Christian bent (it claims to want to end “anti-Christian degeneracy”). This is a departure from European Identitarian ideology, which is less focused on Christianity. In the “Faith” section of its platform, the TWP calls for “religious freedom,” but this translates to advocating for discrimination in the name of religion: “If a business owner’s conscience compels him to serve one customer instead of another or refuse to sell a particular product, then the state should not interfere.” The “Family” section of the TWP’s platform also promotes a definition of marriage that is molded by “clergy and local tradition,” takes a strict anti-abortion stance, and advocates for “traditional” gender roles, with women staying home to care for children if possible. The TWP’s anti-gay stance has at times has led to conflict with others on the Neo-Nazi who want to include white gay people in the movement. When Heimbach wasn’t invited to the white nationalist National Policy Institute’s fall 2015 conference, it was rumored that it was because of his anti-gay views. (National Policy Institute leader Richard Spencer has waffled on the issue of LGBT inclusion to avoid alienating potential supporters on either side of that issue.)

The TWP is blatantly anti-Semitic. In part of its “Folk” section, subtitled “Regulate Foreign Lobbies,” it airs the ancient “dual loyalty” claim about Jews: “The State of Israel has a large and powerful Jewish population in America, many of whom are more loyal to Israel than they are to America.” The theory that Jews are not fully loyal to the U.S. is a common anti-Semitic trope and is also demonstrably false. In an April 2012 poll by the Public Religion Research Institute, just 4% of Jews said a candidate’s stance on Israel determined their vote. By contrast, a 2015 poll by Bloomberg Politics found that 58% of born-again Christians said they would support Israel even when it went against American interests. So-called “Christian Zionists” support Israel because they believe it is a key player in the biblical End Times.

Similarly, in a 2015 blog post, Heimbach writes: “All nationalists, regardless of ethnicity, should stand united against our common foes, the rootless international clique of globalists and bankers that wish to dominate all free peoples on the Earth.” The reference is a classic anti-Semitic phrase that actually reference to Jews.

While the TWP is unquestionably part of the radical right, it also departs from the views of many such groups with its criticism of capitalism and its endorsement of environmentalism. It supports government assistance and social programs, albeit for white people. It is staunchly anti-abortion, for example, but simultaneously calls for “expanded adoption assistance, expanded welfare and social service assistance for unwed mothers, and even more assistance for wed mothers and their husbands.” It opposes trade deals, saying they benefit giant corporations instead of families. And in a December 2015 blog post — titled “Learning from Europe: How Our Nationalist Movement Can Enter the 21st Century” — Heimbach endorses economic “third positionism.” That refers to a rejection of both capitalism and communism, a position espoused by Nazi leader Gregor Strasser (later assassinated by fellow Nazis who didn’t agree), who Heimbach quotes: “We must take from the right nationalism without capitalism and from the left socialism without internationalism.”

Heimbach goes on to at least nominally reject “white supremacy,” calling it a “neo-colonialist fixation on ‘greater’ and ‘lesser’ evil people.” In this regard, Heimbach diverges from the academic racists who spend their time trying to prove the intellectual superiority of white people. “A nationalist movement historically and today is based on love of ones [sic] culture, Identity, traditions, and ethnic extended family, not hatred of other groups simply because they are different,” he writes. He even sharply criticizes the seminal neo-Nazi novel The Turner Diaries, which gleefully describes a race war and the extermination of non-whites, Jews, gay people and “race-mixers,” and attempts to frame white nationalism as an anti-colonial struggle aligned with oppressed peoples around the world. Immigrants should leave the U.S., Heimbach says, not because they’re inferior, but because they “just don’t belong here.” When someone commented on the post, saying that Heimbach ought to acknowledge the superiority of whites to other races, Parrott replied and challenged him, arguing that “there’s no objective metric of societal value.”

But none of this has kept the TWP from close alliances with white supremacists.

In fact, Heimbach has been associating with neo-Nazis and Klansmen for years, even before the formation of the TWP. In 2013, he praised neo-Nazi David Duke and joined a cross and swastika lighting hosted by the Aryan Terror Brigade, the Imperial Klans of America and the National Socialist Movement. That led to his brief expulsion from the League of the South, a neo-Confederate white supremacist group trying to appear more moderate, though he was reinstated shortly after.

The fraternization with neo-Nazis and their ilk has continued under the banner of the TWP. In June 2016, The Barnes Review, a journal specializing in Holocaust denial, announced a partnership with TWP and TYN, giving their members a discounted subscription rate and several free books with their order, including Russia and the Jews and A Straight Look at the Second World War. In a website posting, the TYN praised The Barnes Review as an “esteemed revisionist publication which has been cutting through the bias and distortions to get to the historical truth for decades.”

Shortly afterwards, in July 2016, the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement (NSM) announced that the TWP had joined its Aryan Nationalist Alliance (ANA), a coalition of white nationalist organizations. The ANA was first unveiled by NSM leader Jeff Schoep in April 2016, and its list of member organizations includes neo-Nazi, Klan, and racist skinhead groups. The mission statement of the ANA uses many of the same talking points as the TWP: it claims that the ANA is a “legal and non-violent anti-colonialist movement” whose members “reject racial supremacy and racial hatred.” But that is plainly nonsense — the NSM says on its FAQ page that “[c]ommon sense tells us that there are obvious real physical differences and history shows us there are fundamental differences between the races that drive the White Race to be the most advanced and progress producing race on earth.” Likewise, the ANA mission statement quotes Nazi collaborator Leon Degrelle as saying, “National Socialist racialism was not against the other races, it was for its own race.” Anyone with a passing knowledge of history knows that claim is entirely false.

Why does the TWP make alliances like these? In a 2013 essay, Matthew Parrott says that while he finds “much to admire and respect in contemporary Black American, Latin American, and Jewish culture,” his work “doesn’t exist in a vacuum, devoid of historical context. I’m opposed to usurious Jewish bankers, just like Hitler. I’m fed up with negro criminality, just like the first Klan. I’m proud of my racial identity, just like Dr. William Pierce [the late leader of the neo-Nazi National Alliance]. I share Anders Breivik’s commitment to push the Muslim invaders out of our Western homelands.” In 2011, Breivik murdered 77 of his countrymen in Norway, many of them children, because he thought they were enabling Muslim immigration.

In fall 2015, the TWP named the first candidates to represent the party: Tony Hovater, a candidate for city council in New Carlisle, Ohio, and Tom Pierce, a candidate for county commissioner in Knox County, Tennessee. Hovater didn’t win a seat. By 2016, Pierce was advertising himself as an “independent” candidate, though he’s still espousing white nationalist views on his Facebook page: “There is no country allowed solely for the White, Christian. I say the Appalachian Bible Belt is our country and if we do not act to secure it then we will not survive.”

In summer 2016, the TWP announced its first endorsement, for Rick Tyler, a candidate for congressman in Tennessee. Tyler is known for putting up billboards that say “Make America White Again,” which prompted outcry among locals and calls for boycott of the restaurant Tyler owned. The TWP pledged to help Tyler with his campaign, with Parrott writing that Tyler’s campaign was “an unexpected opportunity to achieve a national impact in our party’s first election cycle.”

However, as the group’s website says, running and endorsing candidates is just part of what it does. Heimbach has mentioned that the TWP aims to have regional meetings in addition to monthly local meetings, to distribute a quarterly publication to members, and to hold community events and demonstrations. By summer 2016, it had at least seven chapters around the nation, including in Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, the mid-Atlantic, Indiana, and Texas. During the first half of 2016, the TWP warmly praised GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.

“Donald Trump is blowing the dog whistle for White racial interests harder than any other candidate, and louder than the Republic elites would ever dream a candidate would do in our politically correct age,” Heimbach wrote in a blog post in fall 2015. He said he would be campaigning for Trump because, “While Donald Trump is neither a Traditionalist nor a White nationalist, he is a threat to the economic and social powers of the international Jew.” Elsewhere — in a March 2016 speech to members of the white nationalist Council of Conservative Citizens — Heimbach called Trump a “gateway drug” for white nationalism. “We can then move [Trump supporters] from civic nationalism and populism to nationalism for us,” he said.

Despite the TWP’s talk of nonviolence, Heimbach attended a Trump rally in Louisville, Ky., where he was seen repeatedly shoving a black woman, 21-year-old Kashiya Nwanguma. In April 2016, Nwanguma joined two others in suing Trump for inciting violence at his rallies; Heimbach was also named as a defendant. In July, the authorities charged Heimbach with misdemeanor harassment in the incident.

In June 2016, the TWP held a rally for “Faith, Family, and Folk” in Sacramento, Calif., with the Golden State Skinheads and Blood & Honour America Division, both racist hate groups. Violence erupted between the racists and counter-protesters almost immediately, leaving nine people hospitalized, only one of them a white nationalist. (Neither Parrott nor Heimbach were present at the rally). Police officials said later that the counter-protesters had started the violence.

If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.

EmmaBest,Vinlanders Social Club,Completed,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/vinlanders-social-club-31277/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning Vinlanders Social Club, which was formed in 2003 by a handful of former members and associates of a rogue racist skinhead group, the Outlaw Hammerskins. Publicly the Vinlanders appeared to be a coalition of independent state skinhead crews, but in reality the group functioned as a single entity.

Brien James, Eric “the Butcher” Fairburn, Bryon Widner, Nate Sliter and Donald Weirich were no strangers to the racist skinhead scene when they formed the Vinlanders Social Club in 2003. James, Widner and Sliter had been members of a skinhead faction called the Outlaw Hammerskins, and Fairburn and Weirich were “hang-arounds,” or associates of the group, before starting in 2002 the Hoosier State Skinheads, a group that operated out of Indiana and Illinois. They recruited members in Ohio to start a neighboring faction, the Ohio State Skinheads. Though outwardly it appeared the two groups were separate, in reality they functioned as a single organization. As more crews were created, they all became part of what came to be known as the Vinlanders Social Club.

According to a statement by James posted on the Vinlanders website in 2007, the group was created “because we were disappointed with the movement that we dedicated our young lives to.” James wrote that the Vinlanders “was to be something that was going to replace and surpass the old guard in the skinhead scene. Even by force if necessary.” The Vinlanders was formed in large part as a direct challenge to Hammerskin Nation, a coalition of Hammerskin crews that had dominated the racist skinhead scene for more than a decade.

The schism between the Hammerskins and Vinlanders was evident in October 2005, when a meeting of the National Skinhead Council was held on the Ohio property of a Blood & Honour/C18 member. Blood & Honour and C18 – short for Combat 18 – are affiliated racist skinhead groups that split off from Blood & Honour Worldwide in England. The Vinlanders aligned themselves with the American spinoffs, while Hammerskin Nation supported Blood & Honour Worldwide. More than a dozen white supremacist groups – mostly skinhead crews but also the Imperial Klans of America (IKA) and the neo-Nazi National Alliance – were in attendance, and by the close of business the coalition decided to call itself Council 28 (2 standing for B, representing Blood; and 8 for H, meaning Honour.) Conspicuously absent were any Hammerskins and groups allied with them, such as the Portland, Ore.-based, skinhead group Volksfront.

The next gathering of Council 28 was much more eventful than the first. The Vinlanders and their allies met on Memorial Day weekend 2006 at the annual Nordic Fest hate-rock festival held at the IKA compound in Kentucky. Fairburn and James posed for a photo, mocking Hammerskin Nation by holding its flag upside down.

When Steven Boswell, a member of the Missouri branch of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement, spoke to the crowd at Nordic Fest, he said that the white supremacist movement couldn’t succeed “by belonging to a social club where all we do is drink and shoot the shit every Saturday night.” The Vinlanders, assuming the comment was directed at their social club, took offense. As soon as Boswell left the stage, they pummeled and kicked him repeatedly as his wife and 10-year-old daughter watched in horror. The assault buttressed the Vinlanders’ “take no prisoners” reputation among some in the movement, but many older white supremacists bemoaned the white-on-white violence.

Two months later, Fairburn published an open challenge to Hammerskin Nation for “30 versus 30 mutual combat on neutral ground.” The Vinlanders’ first choice for combat was “fists and boots,” said Fairburn, who also has used the name Eric Wolf. The secondary option: “Bricks, bats, knives, clubs and axes.” Victors in the battle would become “the undisputed leaders of the North American scene,” he added. The Hammerskins didn’t publicly respond, and no battle ensued. Nor was it clear whether Fairburn had issued the challenge on his own or on behalf of the Vinlanders.

By 2007, the Vinlanders had eight chapters in six states. Their affiliated skinhead crews began using the Vinlander name, so the Florida State Skins, for example, became the Florida Vinlanders. But a violent encounter in downtown Indianapolis in March of that year between Fairburn, fellow Vinlanders Tim Dumas and Josh Kern and an African-American man signaled a reversal in the group’s fortunes.

According to police reports and media accounts, as Dexter Lewis passed a sidewalk table occupied by the Vinlanders, he commented to Fairburn, “Nice tattoo.” It’s unclear which tattoo he meant, as Fairburn had quite a few, including the Vinlanders insignia inked atop his scalp and the word “Murder” etched across his neck. In any case, Fairburn didn’t take the remark as a compliment. “Nigger, don’t you dare stop,” he replied.

Lewis kept going. Within a few minutes, Fairburn, Dumas and Kern tracked him down at a nearby intersection, knocked him out and then continued to punch and kick him in the face and stomach after Lewis collapsed in a crosswalk. Undeterred by the large crowd of witnesses that had gathered, one of the Vinlanders allegedly yelled to a spectator who tried to stop the attack, “Back off or you’ll get a piece of this, too.” Another of the trio told a woman on a cell phone, “If you call 911, I’ll kill you.”

All three skins were arrested a short time later. In 2007, Dumas pleaded guilty to a felony charge of criminal recklessness and was sentenced to a year in prison. Kern pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery and received 60 days. Fairburn, the ringleader in the attack, was sentenced to five years in prison, with three years suspended.

Shackled and handcuffed, Fairburn did his best to sound contrite during his sentencing hearing, respectfully answering “Yes ma’am” and “No ma’am” to the black woman judge peering down on him from the bench. When she announced that she was barring him from associating with skinheads or any other white supremacists as a condition of his suspended sentence, Fairburn didn’t hesitate to renounce the Vinlanders in open court.

“I’m no longer a member of the Vinlanders and I no longer have any association or ties whatsoever with the Vinlanders Social Club or any other [racist] clubs or anything,” Fairburn said. “I haven’t been around those people in over a year. I’m 34 years old, and I’ve got too much going on in my life to waste any more of it. ... When I decided to get out, I grabbed as many people as I could and ran for the door. Anybody who I thought I could talk some sense into, I did, and a few quit along with me.”

In fact, several longtime members did quit, in some cases joining outlaw motorcycle gangs. Others were arrested on their own criminal charges.

In September 2007, Vinlanders co-founder James stated on the group’s website that the Vinlanders and Hammerskin Nation had negotiated a truce, ending a three-year feud. “Vinlanders and the Hammerskin Nation have been conducting meetings and parties on both sides have decided to declare peace,” he wrote. But the Hammerskins made no public acknowledgement of the purported truce or the negotiations that supposedly preceded it. To the contrary, Volksfront (VF) leader Randal Krager, whose group is allied with the Hammerskins, issued a press release claiming that neither VF nor any of its affiliates had or would “make any deals with persons who have attempted to harm or slander VF.”

James declared himself the leader of the Vinlanders, which entered a period of decline. He published a lengthy statement on the group’s website in 2007 saying that the group was going its own way in the “white racialist movement.” He added, “We have attempted to change this movement from within and have not succeeded. It is our opinion that a large number of the people involved in the greater movement are paid informants, social outcasts, and general losers in life.”

There was more violence to come from Vinlanders members. In 2009, Michael Parrish, a corrections officer in Monroe County, Penn., and, secretly, a probationary member of the Vinlanders, killed his live-in girlfriend and their 2-year-old son. His apartment was filled with Nazi memorabilia, including photos and DVDs depicting Adolf Hitler. In 2010, he pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder.

In September 2010, the Phoenix New Times reported that more than a dozen members or associates of the Vinlanders in that area had been arrested in the previous year, essentially wiping them out in Arizona. Two of the reputed members, Travis Ricci and Aaron Schmidt, were indicted for the drive-by shotgun slaying of a white woman walking at night with her African-American boyfriend. Another alleged Vinlander was arrested and charged with trying to intimidate a witness in Ricci and Schmidt’s case. In May 2011, Ricci was sentenced in another case to 22 years in state prison for bashing his girlfriend’s head into a wall at a party and stabbing the two men who came to her aid, one in the hand, the other in the neck.

After being released from prison in 2009 for his Indianapolis assault, Fairburn turned himself in to police in that city in September 2010 and confessed to the 2004 murder of a man in Springfield, Mo. The man, William McDaniel, was allegedly responsible for the drunken driving death of one of Fairburn’s friends. In June 2011 Fairburn was convicted of second-degree murder and is serving life in prison.

In June 2011, Bryon Widner was the focus of the MSNBC documentary “Erasing Hate,” which chronicled the excruciating series of treatments he received to remove the racist tattoos that covered his face and neck. Widner, who had left the movement in 2006, publicly renounced his white supremacist views.

In the summer of 2011, the Vinlanders held their first-ever white power concert, entitled “Plunder and Pillage,” which drew more than 50 racist skins to Ohio from around the country. Then, at a later concert James hung out with Richie Myers, head of the Florida faction of the Confederate Hammerskins, a sign that the truce declared four years earlier with the Hammerskins apparently was still in force.

Typified by its slogan, “God Hates Fags,” WBC is known for its harsh anti-gay beliefs and the crude signs its members carry at their frequent protests.
 
The Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) is made up of its leader, Pastor Fred Waldron Phelps, nine of his 13 children (the other four are estranged), their children and spouses, and a small number of other families and individuals. Phelps has maintained tight control over the group. His estranged son Nathan says the elder Phelps abused his children and his wife, cultivating an atmosphere of fear to maintain his authority.

They believe that God chooses some to be saved, and those lucky few cannot resist God's call; but God chooses not to save most, and these unfortunate souls will burn in hell forever. The ""Frequently Asked Questions,"" or FAQ section of the WBC website explains: ""Your best hope is that you are among those he has chosen. Your prayer every day should be that you might be. And if you are not, nothing you say or do will serve as a substitute.""

WBC specializes in anti-gay vitriol. Its main website is titled ""God Hates Fags."" That website says, ""The only true Nazis in this world are fags. They want to force you by law to support their filth, and they want to shut you up by law when they hate what you say."" According to the group, America has damned itself through its tolerance of homosexuality, and God is punishing the country by inflicting tragedies on its citizens. For example, when two sets of twin girls drowned in Massachusetts in separate incidents in July and August 2010, the WBC blamed their deaths on the state's 2004 legalization of same-sex marriage.

The church held its first service on Nov. 27, 1955. Fred Phelps raised his family near the church and many members of the Phelps family live in houses on the WBC compound. These houses are arranged in a box formation and share a large backyard. In 1964, Fred founded Phelps-Chartered, a law firm that has come to represent the church in its civil suits. All five of the firms' attorneys are his children. The Kansas Supreme Court disbarred Phelps in 1979, stating that Phelps showed ""little regard for the ethics of his profession.""

The WBC came to public attention when it began its ""picketing ministry,"" meaning their practice of holding controversial protests to raise awareness of the church and its beliefs. In line with their belief in predestination, the pickets are not aimed at winning followers, but only at warning them of their coming damnation. They began picketing in June 1991, and claim to have picketed more than 40,000 times since then. Though this works out to nearly six protests a day, the church regularly schedules that many or more daily protests on an ongoing basis, although it doesn't hold every protest it advertises. At its protests, WBC members hold inflammatory signs bearing messages like ""God Hates Fags,"" ""God Hates Jews,"" ""Thank God for Dead Soldiers"" and ""Thank God for AIDS.""

The church has used its right to protest to harass local businesses and individuals in Topeka, Kan. They reportedly picketed a local restaurant every day for three years because its owner knowingly employed a lesbian. Many of the group's targets seem chosen at random: the church picketed a concert by young Canadian pop star Justin Bieber because he was not using his fame to promote God. Other targets have included Bill Clinton's mother, Sonny Bono, Lady Gaga, and Bob Dole. Shirley Phelps-Roper, who is a frequent protester and one of Fred Phelps' children, will sometimes wear American flags hanging from her pants while protesting, so that they scrape against the ground as she walks. She has allowed her children to step on an American flag during protests. The WBC uses tactics like these to win media attention and spread its message.

Children in the Phelps family are raised in the church's beliefs, and their upbringing offers them few opportunities to integrate into mainstream society. It is common to see young children from the Phelps family at WBC pickets, often holding the group's hateful signs. These children casually use the words ""fag"" and ""dyke"" in interviews, and the older children report having no close friends at school. The Phelps family raises its children to hold hateful and upsetting views, and to believe that all people not in WBC will go to hell. The tenets of WBC are so strict that no other churches are taken to be legitimate. The children quickly grow alienated in school and in society, leading them to build relationships almost exclusively within the family. This helps to explain why nine of Fred Phelps' 13 children have remained members of the church.

Fred Phelps and his small congregation provide WBC's funding; the group neither solicits nor accepts outside donations. In addition to this income, the church makes money by winning or settling civil lawsuits involving the church. During the 1990s, the group sued Topeka multiple times for failing to provide sufficient protection during its protests. Although they lost most of their cases, WBC did win $43,000 in legal fees in 1993. According to Shirley Phelps-Roper, they also won more than $100,000 in 1995 in a lawsuit against Kansas' Funeral Picketing Act, which they claimed violated their First Amendment rights. Because the Phelps family represents WBC in court, they can put the fees they win towards supporting the church.

As of 2007, several WBC members worked for the state, providing an additional income stream. According to Seattle-based Prison Legal News, members of the Phelps clan then in the employ of the state of Kansas included Fred Phelps' daughter Margie, the Department of Corrections' (DOC) director of re-entry planning; Fred Phelps Jr., a staff attorney with the DOC; and Timothy Phelps, a spokesman for the Shawnee County DOC. Margie Phelps was even awarded ""Kansas Correctional Association Employee of the Quarter"" in late 2005 — this despite her arrest at a 2004 protest at a dedication ceremony for the Brown v. Board of Education Historical Site in Topeka. Abigail Phelps, another Westboro activist, worked in the staff development office for Kansas' Juvenile Justice Authority. Lee Ann Phelps and Elizabeth Phelps both formerly held positions with the Shawnee County Sheriff's Department.

In February 2007, Prison Legal News, which monitors human-rights abuses within America's prison system, filed an ethics complaint with Kansas legal officials against Shirley Phelps-Roper. The complaint alleged that Phelps violated legal ethical canons because of the extreme vitriol she directed toward gays and lesbians on a radio show. The state's Office of the Disciplinary Administrator declined to pursue it, citing the First Amendment.

On Oct. 12, 1998, gay student Matthew Shepard died of injuries inflicted in a brutal hate crime in Laramie, Wyo. What vaulted WBC to worldwide infamy was its decision to protest Shepard's funeral held on Oct. 16, 1998. Members picketed carrying signs that read ""God Hates Fags"" and ""AIDS Kills Fags Dead."" The group also attempted without success to build a granite monument in a public park in Casper, Wyo., declaring: ""Matthew Shepard, Entered Hell October 12, 1998, in Defiance of God's Warning: ‘Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind; it is abomination.' Leviticus 18:22."" The group's website maintains a virtual ""memorial"" to Matthew Shepard, which depicts him burning in hell.

In June 2005, WBC began picketing the funerals of American soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. The group maintains that God is punishing America for tolerating homosexuality and persecuting WBC. They even claimed that God had chosen to use improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, to kill American soldiers because of an August 1995 attack on the WBC compound with a small explosive device. In a June 2005 interview with Fox News, Fred Phelps said: ""God is visiting the sins upon America by killing their kids with IEDs ... and the more the merrier.""

On March 10, 2006, the WBC picketed the funeral of Matthew Snyder, a Marine who was killed while serving in Iraq. WBC members held signs reading ""Thank God for dead soldiers"" and ""You're going to Hell."" Matthew's father, Albert Snyder, sued WBC for defamation, invasion of privacy, and emotional distress, going to trial in 2007. He originally won a $10.9 million judgment, but it was reversed on appeal in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. On March 8, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal. On March 19, 2010, the Fourth Circuit ordered Albert Snyder to pay more than $16,000 for the WBC's court costs. Snyder described the Fourth Circuit's order as ""a slap in the face."" In early March 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected WBC's right to hold protests at funerals.

On Oct. 2, 2006, five Amish girls were murdered in a Pennsylvania schoolhouse. The WBC announced plans to picket their funerals, but agreed to abstain in exchange for one hour of airtime on talk-show host Mike Gallagher's radio program. On Oct. 3, 2006, on the Fox News program Hannity and Colmes, Shirley Phelps-Roper said, ""They [the Amish girls] did deserve to die.""

On June 5, 2007, Shirley Phelps-Roper was arrested while protesting in Bellevue, Neb. Shirley had allowed her son to stand on an American flag, while she wore a flag around her waist, allowing it to drag along the ground as she walked. Shirley was charged under a Nebraska flag desecration law. She was also charged with negligent child abuse, disturbing the peace, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor (because she allowed her son to violate the flag law.) On July 27, 2010, the city of Bellevue dropped the charges of flag desecration and contributing to the delinquency of a child, due to a federal judge declaring the flag desecration law unconstitutional. The city also paid Phelps-Roper $17,000 in a settlement agreement, in exchange for her dropping a pending lawsuit against the city. However, the city did not drop the charges of disturbing the peace and negligent child abuse.

WBC members have been banned from other countries because of their hateful views. In August 2008, WBC announced its plans to protest the funeral of a man beheaded on a Greyhound Bus in Canada. In response, Canada barred the group's members from entering the country, and the funeral was conducted uninterrupted. In February 2009, the group planned to travel to Britain to protest a staging of ""The Laramie Project,"" a highly respected play that documents the hate murder of gay student Matthew Shepard and how the incident impacted the community. In response, Britain banned Fred Phelps and Shirley Phelps-Roper from traveling to the United Kingdom.

Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy.""

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

EmmaBest,WorldNetDaily,Completed,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/worldnetdaily-31241/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning WorldNetDaily AKA WND.com, which is an online publication founded and run by Joseph Farah that claims to pursue truth, justice and liberty. But in fact, its pages are devoted to manipulative fear-mongering and outright fabrications designed to further the paranoid, gay-hating, conspiratorial and apocalyptic visions of Farah and his hand-picked contributors from the fringes of the far-right and fundamentalist worlds.

WorldNetDaily is a 15-year-old online publication founded and edited by Joseph Farah with the stated goal of ""seeking truth and justice and revitalizing the role of the free press as a guardian of liberty."" Serving up a daily dose of conspiracy theories, apocalyptic alerts and anti-gay rhetoric, WND was ranked by Alexa in 2012 as the 1,832nd most popular website in the world and the 423rd in the U.S. That ranks just above Nickelodeon and a few spots below Victoria’s Secret.

Fear-mongering is WorldNetDaily's specialty. It regularly publishes paranoid fantasies billed as fact, such as a baseless six-part series claiming that soybean consumption causes homosexuality. It has heavily promoted The Pink Swastika, a wretched opus by gay-basher Scott Lively that claims gay men orchestrated the Holocaust. WND also fingered Satan as the first leftist, and trumpeted a secret 20-point Muslim plan “for conquering the United States by 2020.” Another secret plan WND has warned about concerns international elites’ alleged intention to create a “North American Union” that merges Mexico, the United States and Canada.

Theories about when and how the government — and the world — will collapse are regular WND fodder. It seems to bother no one on the staff that most of these theories are conflicting. WND repeatedly uncovers (manufactures is a better word) sinister government plots, trumpeting them with scare headlines such as ""Feds Accused of Fomenting Blood in Our Streets"" — standard fodder for adherents and sympathizers of the conspiracy-oriented, antigovernment “Patriot” movement. As the government allegedly prepares to turn on the citizenry and intern them in already built secret camps, WND’s readers are advised in breathless advertisements to invest all their assets in gold and buy as many guns as they can.

""How do authoritarians and totalitarians usually gain power?"" asked Farah in a February 2013 column. ""One of the tried-and-true methods is to foment social chaos. It happened in the Bolshevik revolution. It happened in Adolf Hitler’s Germany in the 1930s. It happened in Mao’s 'cultural revolution.' It’s important to understand – and this is hard for most of us – that crime and mayhem and lawlessness are actual goals of transformational socialists.""

One of WND's longest running ""controversies"" concerns whether President Obama is a “natural-born” U.S. citizen, originally stirred up by WND columnist Jerome Corsi. Long after the president’s “long-form” birth certificate was released, Corsi continued to pursue the “birther” nonsense. Corsi, incidentally, was also the architect of the “Swift boating” of John Kerry during the 2004 presidential campaign.

In addition to Corsi, WND columnists comprise a cross-section of reactionaries and fringe wingnuts, including arch-conservative Alan Keyes; actor and mud-slinger Chuck Norris; failed presidential candidate Rick Santorum; race-baiting and  homophobic ex-Major Leaguer John Rocker; radio hothead Rush Limbaugh; and white nationalist writer Pat Buchanan, who was named WND's 2012 Man of the Year. (Trumping that honor was libertarian U.S. Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), who was named WND's Man of the Decade.)

Santorum is one of the newer WND columnists, following his failed bid for the GOP nomination. His weekly column began in December 2012, kicking off with a familiar refrain: his controversial opposition to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Bottom line: Santorum has a disabled daughter, but argued that the treaty is wrong because it cedes ""our sovereignty"" to the United Nations. To the surprise of many, the U.S. Senate failed to ratify the treaty soon afterwards, with 38 Republicans voting no.

As a career politician who still harbors presidential ambitions, Santorum is more cautious than some of his WND stablemates. Inane guitar slinger and gun nut Ted Nugent stirred up a hornet's nest of criticism after he wrote a WND column opposing the use of government drones. The topic is fair game, except he took things to an extreme by theorizing what would happen if a Republican president were to authorize drone attacks on U.S. citizens: ""Jesse Jackson and Al Not-So-Sharpton would be lisping their ebonic mumbo-jumbo that the policy and the president are racist and bigoted. They would organize protest marches in front of the White House, where they would burn effigies of the president."" 

Nugent subsequently was invited to attend Barack Obama's 2013 State of the Union address as the guest of Texas Republican Rep. Steve Stockman.

Like many large websites, in addition to selling online ads, WND also profits through book and merchandise sales. 

The WND Superstore, linked from the main website, offers “Unique Products for Discerning Minds.” Such minds apparently crave items like the NRA-endorsed Second Amendment Range Pack, designed to hold four pistols and 36 magazines in an attractive carry-all imprinted with the words of the Second Amendment. The superstore also offers 830 books on “history, theology, philosophy, political science, education, natural science, society, and family.” These are “thoroughly examined” by WND’s “review board” to “enlighten and empower you in your personal quest to protect your family, engage the culture, speak out against injustice, and fight for what is right.”

Discerning readers will want to pick up books such as Jerome Corsi's The Late Great USA, subtitled as ""The North American Union and the Threat of a Coming Merger with Mexico and Canada."" Another potboiler is Richard Wurmbrand’s Marx & Satan, hailed by Joseph Farah as “a book that changed my life and worldview,” which details how the young Karl Marx “received the rights of initiation” of a “secret Satanist church” and became the Devil’s “elect servant.”

Bestselling videos at the superstore include a Farah-produced documentary titled ""The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment: Is There An Ancient Mystery That Foretells America's Future?,"" and ""Dreams from My Real Father,"" a documentary purporting to explore the origins of President Obama's supposed Marxism.

WND’s “Taking America Back National Conference” (also the title of a book by Farah) was launched as an alternative to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, which Farah boycotted because an LGBT Republican group was included. Far-right luminaries in the 2010 speaker lineup included U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), former “Saturday Night Live” cast member Victoria Jackson, former U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.), anti-gay hate group leader and Christian Reconstructionist theologian Gary DeMar, and R.C. Sproul Jr., a mover-and-shaker in the theocratic Christian “patriarchy” movement and a prominent homeschooling advocate.

As WND's publisher and editor-in-chief, Joseph Farah writes a daily column and stirs this toxic stew. After a checkered newspaper career, culminating in his ill-advised attempt as executive editor to turn the Sacramento Union into a fundamentalist Christian, anti-gay mouthpiece, Farah founded the Western Center for Journalism (WCJ) in 1991. A nonprofit entity whose purpose was “to encourage more philosophical diversity in the news media,” WCJ spawned WorldNetDaily in 1997. Two years later, WND became an independent for-profit company with $4.5 million from an unnamed investor. 

Not surprisingly, WND’s board members are politically active in a variety of right-wing causes. In addition to Farah and his wife Elizabeth, the board includes Wayne Johnson, Norman Book, James Clark and Richard Botkin.

Johnson, who has been on WND’s board since 1999, is a Sacramento political consultant whose firm, according to TheRawStory, coordinated the campaign for California’s Proposition 8, which sought to outlaw same-sex marriage in that state. Until June 2002, he was a board member of the Chalcedon Foundation, a Christian Reconstructionist outfit and anti-gay hate group.

Book, who joined the board in 2008, is WND’s executive vice president of finance and technology. As an undergraduate at Stanford University, he co-founded The Stanford Review, which according to his LinkedIn profile was a conservative student weekly meant to “add balance to Stanford’s stifling liberal atmosphere.”

Clark, a board member since 1999, was difficult to track down. Based on the address he listed on WND’s tax form, he appears to be a recently departed lobbyist for the American Bankers Association (ABA). According to his LinkedIn profile, he served as ABA liaison to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a controversial and highly secretive group of far-right state legislators and business lobbyists that writes and pushes model bills and is funded by the far-right Koch brothers. One of those ALEC-backed bills was the pro-gun “Stand Your Ground” law that authorities cited as their reason for not immediately recommending charges against George Zimmerman, the Florida man who shot and killed unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in February 2012.

Least noteworthy is Botkin, a Sacramento-area financial advisor and former Marine who has been on the board since 1999 and is an occasional contributor to conservative candidates. According to ConWebWatch, he worked with Farah in 2004 during a short-lived effort to revive the Sacramento Union as a magazine. His book about the Vietnam War was published by WND.

From 2000 to 2002, the board also included Robert Beale, an MIT grad who made his money in computers, served as the Minnesota campaign manager for televangelist Pat Robertson’s 1988 presidential bid, and eventually came to sympathize with the radical antigovernment “sovereign citizens” movement. In 2008, Beale was convicted of tax evasion, conspiracy, and fleeing authorites, charges he attempted to evade first by hiding from the law and then by conspiring to intimidate the judge — who, he said, God had commanded him to “destroy” — by filing fraudulent liens and issuing fake “arrest warrants” against her.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, 214 and 266 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.",1363741-000,False,1636,1498,Haters: Documenting Extremist and Hate Groups,,0.00,2016-12-23 05:00:00+00:00,2017-01-25,2017-05-10 00:00:00+00:00,worldnetdaily-31241
