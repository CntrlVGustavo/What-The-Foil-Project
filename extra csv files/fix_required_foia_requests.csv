Her meeting at a dance-club with society osteopath Stephen Ward drew her into fashionable circles. At the height of the Cold War, she became sexually involved with a married government minister, John Profumo, as well as a Soviet diplomat. A shooting incident between two of her other lovers caused the press to investigate her, revealing that her affairs could be threatening national security. In the House of Commons, Profumo denied any improper conduct but later admitted that he had lied. This incident discredited the Conservative government of Harold Macmillan in 1963 in what became known as the Profumo affair. Keeler was never charged with being a prostitute, but Ward was found guilty at trial of being her pimp – a trial only instigated after the embarrassment caused to the government.

This request may be limited to materials generated between the date of issue of the Executive Order and January 19, 2017 (EOD). 

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.

Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.

Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.

As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.",,False,940,78,,,0.00,2018-11-19 00:20:18.889645+00:00,,,eo-13587-compliance-and-fulfillment-federal-bureau-of-investigation-64080

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for Motherboard, AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request.

This letter is a formal { law name } request for the following records.


This request concerns records related to Jeffery E. Epstein, who died recently while in Federal custody.

As proof of death, and subject identification, please see:
https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-william-p-barr-death-jeffrey-epstein
https://www.google.com/search?q=Jeffrey+Epstein+death&prmd=niv&source=lnms&tbm=nws

This request includes both state and Federal records, including any such records that may be in each others' possession.



# Expedited processing

I request that part A of this request receive maximally expedited processing, as it concerns journalistic interest in multiple breaking news stories of international significance. For the same reason, I note that the journalistic waiver request below is particularly strong.

Please pay particular attention to the request below for rolling updates. Please prioritize your response in the order of records that can be produced the most quickly (including consideration of e.g. time to review), and keep me appraised of progress, ETAs, and records in pipeline (e.g. pending search or processing).

For the purposes of expedited interim rolling updates only, please ignore the format provisions of this request if (and only if) providing the records in another format would be faster, and only to that extent, i.e. provide the records in the fastest possible manner (and otherwise as requested). If you use this clause, then please say so clearly, and provide such records in the proper requested format pursuant to non-expedited processing.


# Exemptions moot due to death

Because dead people have no Privacy Act rights, this FOIA request includes all records that would otherwise be covered by the Privacy Act. No PA or similar waiver will be provided on anyone's behalf.

Please note that all criminal investigations into or prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein have automatically terminated by his death, and therefore you may not invoke 5 USC 552(b)(7)(A, B, C, or F), or (c)(1), as to Epstein.  See e.g. Davis v. DOJ, 460 F.3d 92, 97-98 (D.C. Cir. 2007); Schrecker v. DOJ, 349 F.3d 657, 661 (D.C. Cir. 2003); and Vest v. Dep't of the Air Force, 793 F. Supp. 2d 103, 122 (D.D.C. 2011) (re (b)(7) of dead people).

You may not claim 552(b)(5) as to records more than 25 years old. Please note that some of the cases listed below predate that cut-off.

Furthermore, if you wish to claim 552(b)(6) exemption as to Epstein's personal privacy, you would need to surmount a very high burden of proof, especially given that what has already been disclosed about Epstein has made it nearly impossible for him to be defamed. Defamation requires that the new information harm his reputation. As a dead serial child sex abuser, he has no reputation left to be harmed. See e.g. Grandison v. DOJ, 600 F. Supp. 2d 103, 114 (D.D.C. 2009); Schoenman v. FBI, 763 F. Supp. 2d 173, 176 (D.D.C. 2011); and Summers v. DOJ, 517 F. Supp. 2d 231, 241 (D.D.C. 2007) (re (b)(6) of dead people). See also Rosenfeld v. DOJ, No. 07-3240, 2012 WL 710186, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 5, 2012) and Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. DOJ, 846 F. Supp. 2d 63, 71 (D.D.C. 2012) (re public figure).

However, I do not facially challenge the ability to invoke:
* (b)(7)(D) (confidential sources)
* (b)(7)(E) (methods)
* (b)(7)(A) (as to enforcement proceedings against someone other than Epstein)
* (b)(7)(B) (as to a reasonably expected prosecution of someone other than Epstein)
* (b)(7)(C) (as to the personal privacy of someone other than Epstein)
* (b)(7)(F) (as to the safety of someone other than Epstein)
(and equivalent state law).


# Exemptions related to any judicial seal

I understand that several responsive records may currently be under seal in one or more courts.

For such records, I stipulate that you may invoke 552(b)(3) (or state law equivalents), and will not contest (b)(3) exemption claims while the seal is in place, provided that you furnish, for each such record:
a) a complete citation to both the sealed record (case name, case number, court, filing date, ECF #) and all order(s) sealing the record (same)
b) a statement detailing any exemptions you claim on that record, other than the mere fact of the order of seal
c) a statement of whether you would object to a press-intervenor motion to unseal the record, given Epstein's death


# Other Jeffrey Epsteins

Please exclude records relating to persons named Jeffrey Epstein who are not the one identified above (i.e. the billionaire repeat sex offender).

I have already made efforts to exclude, e.g. in the case listing below:
Jeffrey M. Epstein
Jeffrey A. Epstein
Jeffrey Epstein, a lawyer in federal practice

If any cases identified in fact are about a different Epstein, please say so, and exclude those records.


# Component delegation

This request covers every { agency name } component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc. See ""# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records"" below.

Please note that this request imposes an affirmative obligation to take immediate steps to preserve responsive records against spoliation, including both any automated or routine record deletion and any act by an employee to delete such records.

This is an explicit evidence preservation demand, and the documents sought relate to ongoing and/or currently contemplated litigation.

At your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.

In either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7), and analogous state law.

In particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.

# Specific records by respondent / originating agency

The following sub-parts give more specific directions by respondent / originating agency.


1. FBI, NYPD, NYSP, PBSO, PBPD, DOJ, USAO SDFL/MDFL/DNJ/SDNY, & FLSA 15th Cir.

Please provide all records you have about Epstein. These records are expected to be primarily related to surveillance, investigation, prosecution, transportation, incarceration, or carceral medical treatment of Epstein; any general dossier(s) about Epstein; and any of the cases listed above.

a) Please search 
i) your automated indices
ii) the older general (manual) indices.
iii) the ELSUR electronic surveillance indices.
iv) all Field Offices, in particular those assigned to or located in MDFL, SDFL, SDNY, DNJ, & 15th Cir.

b) Please include any records related to Epstein's death, and his earlier injury, including photographs, medical records, autopsy, etc.


2. DOJ, NY AG, FL AG, NY Gov, FL Gov, DOJ OPR, & FDLE

Please provide all records you have about Epstein. These records are expected to be primarily related to determinations about pursuing criminal charges against Epstein, review of prosecutorial decisions; ethics / professional responsibility / etc investigations into prosecutors assigned to Epstein; and any of the cases listed above.

a) Please note that this explicitly includes both the recent prosecution of Epstein, and the earlier state prosecutions & investigations which were Federally paralleled by investigation, consideration, and negotiations (though not resulting in a separate Federal indictment).

b) This includes related OPR & FDLE investigations, such as those into Acosta and Kirscher.


3. BOP, NY DOC, NYC DOC, FL DOC, & MCC

Please provide all records you have about Epstein. These records are expected to be primarily related to transportation, incarceration, or carceral medical treatment of Epstein, and any general dossier about Epstein.

a) Please include both HQ / non-local records, and those local to every facility or office in which Epstein was held or transported (however briefly).

b) Please include any records related to Epstein's death, and his earlier injury, including photographs, medical records, autopsy, etc.


# General

For all of the above, you may exclude any records that are part of the public (unsealed) record in any of the cases listed above, and are requested to do so if it would limit (rather than expand) any burdens related to search or production of records.

For all of the above, please first apply and act on a reasonable interpretation of the most likely sources of non-public records of possible public interest, so as to expedite at least partial release of responsive records.

Then, please contact me (at the email below) with an explanation of what records you are likely to have, how difficult they might be to find or produce (e.g. where they might be located, what parts would be more burdensome than others and why, etc), and I will work with you to narrow the request to suit your record storage practices, exclude records that are of no public interest, and limit the burdens of search or production.

Please note that in order to effectively negotiate a narrowing, I would need you to first provide me with such details. I do not know your storage practices and cannot divine where you may or may not have relevant records, nor can I name a specific record without knowing what the options are. I will be most able to narrow the request if provided with options for what to potentially include or exclude.


### 
Fiat Fiendum FOIA template 
Version 5.0
###

# FOIA template structure

All content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.

There is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.


The template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, § 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.

If anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.


The version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  

Please read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.


## Template version updates

If you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.



# Additional FOIA requests

In addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:

B. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.

This part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).

C. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:
1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;
2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and
3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.

Parts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.

Parts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.


For all responsive records, I also request:

D.
1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered ""non-responsive"");
2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;
3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;
4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;
access to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and
5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.

""All parts of the record"" means that the ""record"" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:
a) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);
b) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;
c) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;
d) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; 
etc.

""Related database records"" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.

Items in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.


# Timing

For all requests above, the ""cut-off date"" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.

The priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.


# FOIA IA notice

Please note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA § 6. 

In particular, please note that:
1. you must provide electronic format documents, §§ 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);
2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, § 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);
3. you may not withhold any record unless ""the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law"", § 552(a)(8)(A)(i);
4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, §§ 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and
5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, § 552(b)(5).


# ""Record"" defined

For the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, ""record"" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.


# Anti-duplication exclusion

This request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online ""reading room""), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).

This is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if ""available online""). 

This exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.

This request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.


# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records

Please forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.

This request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.


# Minimal redaction

Please note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.


## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content

When redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.

For example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text ""(b)(7)(C)"", replace each instance of ""Alice"" with ""(b)(7)(C) - Person 1"", each instance of ""Bob"" with ""(b)(7)(C) - Person 2"", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.

Please use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as ""[Alice's cell #]"". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. ""[#52]"", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.

If you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.

This is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section ""creating a new record"", since your act of redaction itself already ""makes a new record"" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.

This provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.

If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.


# Estimates and rolling updates

In order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.

Please provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.


# No new records; electronic & original format

This request does not ask you to create new records. 

If you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.

In particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.

However, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.

I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.

To the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request
1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and
2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.


# Rehab Act § 508 compliance

In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act § 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible — for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).

This means, e.g.:
1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);
2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;
3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act § 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, and I​SO 14289­-1;
4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;
5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address ""aliases"", full lists for ""distribution list"" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;
6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;
7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;
8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),
9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);
10. scans rather than paper copies;
11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;
12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);
13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;
14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. 


# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files

Multiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.

Do not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).

If there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.


# No physical ""duplication""; inspection & direct access

Please note that this request does not request that you physically ""duplicate"" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me — I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.

Furthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. 


# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date

Upon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).


# Communication about this request and method for responding

If you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.

Please ensure that all of your responses comply with § 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, and I​SO 14289­-1.

In particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request — including notification and responsive records — by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. 

Do not respond using ZixCorp ""Secure Mail"" or any other method that ""expires"" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.


# ""Reasonable description"" and tailoring

Please note that a request need only be ""reasonably described"" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.

If you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. 

Please include in any response about ""reasonably described"", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.


# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver

I am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.

This request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.

1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.

This request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.

2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.

3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.

4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.

5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since
a. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;
b. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;
c. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;
d. they are not currently readily available; and
e. they are likely to be requested by others.

6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes ""duplication"" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the ""other non-commercial requester"" category.


# Requester

This request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).

“Sai” is my full legal name.

Please note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.

Sincerely,
Sai

Broger (October 30, 1913 - February 19, 2006), who was an American Christian missionary, author, radio producer, and public servant. In 1956 Mr. Broger became Deputy Director of the Directorate for Armed Forces Information and Education (Armed Forces Information Service), Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower) - and later Director of that office which he held until 1984. During his tenure Broger conducted many other psychological operations aimed at countering the effects of communist ideology.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.","1390146-000, DOJ-AP-2018-002886",False,1304,1169,,,0.00,2017-11-20 05:00:00+00:00,,,john-c-broger-46014

REPRINTS
Allan Shivers, who was Governor of Texas from 1949 to 1957, longer than any other chief executive of the state, died yesterday of a heart attack. He was 77 years old and lived in Austin.

Mr. Shivers, a maverick Democrat who was prone to bolt his party to support Republican candidates, had pursued varied business interests since retiring from elective office. He was stricken while at work in his office at the InterFirst Bank Austin, formerly the Austin National Bank, of which he was chairman. He died early in the evening at the Seton Medical Center.

Mr. Shivers's civic experience included six years on the Board of Regents of the University of Texas, four of those years as chairman, and he served a term as president of the United States Chamber of Commerce.

Support of Eisenhower

In a political career that began with his election to the Texas Senate in 1935, Mr. Shivers developed into a leader of the Democrats' conservative wing. While Governor he endorsed Dwight D. Eisenhower for President and delivered the state for him in the 1952 election. General Eisenhower's opponent, Adlai E. Stevenson, had refused to support Texas's claim to Gulf of Mexico tidelands.

Mr. Shivers also backed Richard M. Nixon for the Presidency 20 years later.

A dedicated conservative, Mr. Shivers inevitably came into conflict with two liberal Texas Democrats, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson and House Speaker Sam Rayburn. In 1956 he fought the future President and Rayburn for control of the Texas delegation to the Democratic National Convention and the ''Shivercrats'' lost. In 1960, however, he endorsed Johnson for President.

He Succeeded to Governorship

Robert Allan Shivers - he never used his first name - was born on Oct. 5, 1907, in Lufkin, Tex. He received bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Texas and immediately entered politics as the assistant sergeant-at-arms of the Texas House, a post suited to his 6-foot 2-inch, 200-pound build. Two years later, in 1935, he was elected to the State Senate, where he served until he became lieutenant governor in 1947.

Mr. Shivers was in his second term when, in July 1949, Gov. Beauford Jester died suddenly. Succeeding to the post, Mr. Shivers quickly came into his own, taking charge of the Democratic Party organization and expanding services in several fields, including mental health, education and prison administration.

Completing an unprecedented three terms as Governor, Mr. Shivers returned to private life to look after extensive property holdings, including a citrus and vegetable farm inherited by his wife, the former Marialice Shary.

For many years Mr. Shivers operated Western Pipe Line Inc., a construction concern with extensive operations in the United States and Canada. He was a director of several Texas banks and a number of industrial corporations.

Surviving, in addition to his wife, are a sister, Maureen Wilson of Pottsboro, Tex.; three sons, John of Fort Worth, Allan Jr. of Austin and Bryan of Dallas; a daughter, Marialice Ferguson of Houston, and 10 grandchildren.

EmmaBest,Stormfront,Fix Required,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/stormfront-31273/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning Stormfront. Created by former Alabama Klan boss and long-time white supremacist Don Black in 1995, Stormfront was the first major hate site on the Internet. Claiming more than 300,000 registered members as of May 2015 (though far fewer remain active), the site has been a very popular online forum for white nationalists and other racial extremists.

Don Black, a former Klan leader who served three years in prison for plotting to overthrow a Caribbean island government, was the first hate propagandist to fully appreciate the potential of the Internet. After learning to operate and program computers in prison, he emerged to set up Stormfront in March 1995, just a month before the Oklahoma City bombing. Being the first of its kind helped Stormfront win enormous publicity. Black and his site, run out of his Florida home, were written up in newspapers around the country and the world. He also frequently appeared on major network news shows like ABC's ""Nightline,"" where, clad in suit and tie, he talked politely about allowing people access to information not filtered by the ""media monopoly."" Though he undoubtedly turned off many viewers, each major TV appearance led to a spike in visitors to Stormfront.

Stormfront has since grown into what may be the Western world's most popular forum for so called ""white nationalists"" to post articles, engage in discussions, and share news of upcoming racist events. One of the secrets to Stormfront's success is its focus on community building. Whereas typical hate sites function as one-way transfers of information — rather like a brochure that can be read but not responded to — Stormfront has always been organized as a message board. Members can post opinions, listen to others respond, then post more feedback for all to read. The potential for dialogues to develop was built in — and, therefore, so was the potential to develop a genuine white supremacist cyber-community.

Below the Stormfront motto, ""White Pride World Wide,"" are links to racially charged news stories like ""Mestizo Rapes White Woman in Elevator"" and ""Negro Man Stabs Elderly Woman, Shoots Detective, Negroes Screaming ‘Police Brutality."" Members of Stormfront's various forums can also post comments to discussion threads with titles like ""What do you want done with the Jews?"", ""Aryan Storm Rising"" and ""To Hate or Not to Hate."" But one thing you won't usually find of late on Stormfront are racial slurs, which, though they sometimes get through, are banned in recent guidelines: ""No profanity. Avoid racial epithets."" New members are explicitly warned not to use such language, and also not to post violent threats or anything describing illegal activity. It's not that Stormfront is about moderation or rational discussion. The talk is all about the evils of African Americans, LGBT people, non-white immigrants, and, above all, Jews, who are blamed for most of what's wrong in the world. But Black clearly has modeled his site on some of the tactics used by David Duke, who famously urged his Klan followers to ""get out of the cow pasture and into hotel meeting rooms."" As Black once told a reporter, ""We don't use the ‘nigger, nigger' type of approaches.""

The ideal of creating an online community was expanded upon in 2002, when Jamie Kelso joined Stormfront. He successfully began to push leading radical-right movement writers — men like Sam Dickson, a leader of the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens, and Willis Carto, publisher of the Holocaust-denying journal The Barnes Review — to start posting. That was just part of an effort to make the site more inclusive. Although some posts are censored on the site (several posts critical of the National Alliance — a major neo-Nazi group — were deleted after the group's founder, William Pierce, died, and an internal war of succession broke out), it generally has tried to maintain a relatively nonsectarian stance, making people from different sectors of the radical right feel welcome to join in. As Black once told a reporter for Newhouse News Service: ""Anyone can work to promote our ideas without being a member of any organization. I used to be annoyed by people who didn't join my organization, but I see the advantage now.""

Black and Kelso have taken care to avoid appearing dictatorial. One result is that the forum, within the bounds of the radical right, feels relatively democratic — a gathering of people with similar interests in what increasingly looks like a real community. Every member can choose a graphic to accompany their postings.

Little smiley faces and other signs abound (Nazi symbology was common until it was banned, along with slurs like ""nigger,"" in the spring of 2008). It's not unusual to spot two members using an animation where the faces toast with mugs of beer. There is a list of birthdays of members on the main page. Birthday greetings are frequently exchanged, along with notes of consolation or encouragement. There are essay contests and $2,000 scholarships for white kids.

In the fall of 2008, a private “sustaining members” section was added to the forum, specifically for those who have supported the site financially. The exclusive enclave of Stormfront’s most influential users eliminated much of the ‘noise’ found in the more popular and openly available sections such as “Newslinks & Articles.” It is also home to the majority of Don Black’s infrequent postings.

The results have been fairly spectacular. In January 2002, Stormfront had a mere 5,000 members. A year later, membership reached 11,000; and a year after that, in early 2004, it had 23,000. By 2008, membership had topped 133,000 registered users, although only about 20,000 were believed to be active posters. That doesn't include the large numbers of those who simply read Stormfront postings without joining up (becoming a member allows one to post messages and also to view personal information posted by other members). 

But Stormfront may have been weakened in the summer of 2008, when the Intelligence Report reported that Black's wife Chloe worked for Emilia Fanjul, wife of Florida sugar baron Jose ""Pepe"" Fanjul, as an executive assistant. Part of Chloe's duties involved serving as a publicist for Glades Academy, a charter school created by Emilia Fanjul to help poor minority children — an irony picked up on by many major media outlets. Despite having a long movement history of her own and having attended an event put on a month earlier by the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens, Chloe Black told The Palm Beach Post that she was ""not involved with the Web site and do not agree with extremist or racially prejudiced views."" White supremacists were not happy. In racist Web forums, they ripped both Don and Chloe as less than true-blue racists, denouncing them for caring more about money, through Chloe's job, than their beliefs.

In 2010, Black, his son Derek, who has since renounced white nationalism, and Duke took up residence on a South Florida news and talk radio station with a large Haitian audience. This bi-weekly program, hosted by the far right-wing Rense Radio Network, was the predecessor for Stormfront Radio, which now reaches North America, as well as over 100 million homes in Europe and the Middle East, daily via satellite.

Later that same year, Stormfront introduced its now annual “Smoky Mountain Summit” near Knoxville, Tenn. Past speakers have included David Duke, Sam Dickson, a CCC member and well known Klan lawyer, Paul Fromm, Matthew Parrott, of the Traditionalist Youth Network (TYN), Matthew Heimbach, also of TYN, Timothy Murchoch, also known as ‘Horace the Avenger’ of White Rabbit Radio, and Freeland Roy Dunscombe, also known as ‘Truck Roy,’ Don Black’s co-host on Stormfront radio. Plans have already been announced to continue the summit in 2015.

In April of 2014, the Southern Poverty Law Center published a white paper entitled “White Homicide Worldwide” documenting the nearly 100 murders committed by members of Stormfront.

Stormfront had accumulated nearly 300,000 members as of its 20th anniversary as of March 2015. Two months later, that benchmark was officially passed. This growth in membership seems poised to continue, despite declining Alexa Internet traffic ratings (which measure all visitors, not just registered members), as the majority of the radical right continues to use the Internet as its primary means of activism.

1. This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act (""FOIA""), 5 U.S.C. § 552, submitted to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (""FBI"") of the United States Department of Justice (""DoJ"").

2. I hereby request agency records from the FBI's Terrorist related to the Improvised Explosive Device (""IED"") attack on January 17, 2004, near Taji, Iraq, that killed United States Army Sergeant (""SGT"") Edmond L. Randle, Jr.; Specialist (“SPC”) Larry E. Polley, Jr.; and Private First Class (“PFC”) Cody J. Orr, while on patrol during Operation Iraqi Freedom (""OIF"") in the CENTCOM Area of Responsibility (""AOR""). The IED attack occurred at Military Grid Reference System (“MGRS”) 38SMC264101.

2.1. SGT Randle was assigned to Battery B, 1st Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery, Fort Hood, Texas.
2.2. SPC Polley and PFC Orr were assigned to Battery B, 2nd Battalion, 20th Field Artillery Regiment, Fort Hood, Texas.

3. The following constraints limit this FOIA request:

3.1. Only specific agency documents related to this IED attack are requested, including:

3.1.1. Combined Information Data Network Exchange (""CIDNE"") Significant Activity (""SIGACT"") report(s);
3.1.2. CIDNE Improvised Explosive Device (""IED"") report(s);
3.1.3. Medical Evacuation (""MEDEVAC"") 9–Line transcript(s);
3.1.4. MEDEVAC Assault Support Request(s) (""ASR"");
3.1.5. Composite Timeline report(s);
3.1.6. Explosive Ordinance Disposal (""EOD"")/Combined Explosives Exploitation Cell (""CEXC"") storyboard report(s);
3.1.7. Serious Incident Report(s) (""SIR"");
3.1.8. Weapons Team Intelligence report(s);
3.1.9. Intelligence Directorate (“C2”) Operations Watch Highlights report(s);
3.1.10. IED Post Patrol Debrief (“64–Liner”) report(s);
3.1.11. Battle Damage Assessment (“BDA”) reports(s);
3.1.12. Multi National Division (""MND"")/Multi National Corps–Iraq (""MNC–I"") IED/EFP Update report(s);
3.1.13. Multi National Force–Iraq (""MNF–I"") Battle Update Assessment(s) (""BUA"") briefing slides;
3.1.14. AR 15–6 Investigation reports (s) and/or Command Directed Investigation (“CDI”) report(s);
3.1.15. Hospital casualty update report(s);
3.1.16. Defense Casualty Information Processing System–Forward (""DCIPS–CF"") report(s).

3.2. Excluding any documents containing the agency’s deliberative material or recommendations;
3.3. Excluding any documents classified Top Secret (“TS”), Sensitive Compartmented Information (“SCI”), and/or Special Access Program (“SAP”); however,
3.4. Including all of CENTCOM’s responsive documents that are classified below the TS, SCI and/or SAP levels; for example, any documents marked Unclassified (“U”), Sensitive But Unclassified (“SBU”), For Official Use Only (“FOUO”), Confidential (“C”), Law Enforcement Sensitive (“LES”), and/or Secret (“S”).

4. Although FOIA has always presumed that government records are open to public inspection, the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Pub. L. 114-185, prohibits agencies from withholding records unless (1) “disclosure is prohibited by law” or (2) “the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by” one of FOIA’s exemptions. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(8)(A). Thus, in addition to FOIA favoring disclosure and requiring its exemptions to be narrowly construed, Section 552(a)(8)(A) prohibits agencies from using their discretion to broadly withhold records merely because they believe an exemption could technically apply.

5. In order to expedite CENTCOM’s release of the requested documents, please disclose them on an interim, rolling basis as they become available; for example, without waiting for all of the agency’s relevant systems of record to be searched, or all of its relevant records to be processed. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

6. If CENTCOM’s processing costs for this request exceed $350.00, please notify me in advance so that I might consider paying any additional fees for a complete and accurate set of responsive documents. The requested documents will be made available to the general public and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

7. Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.

Sincerely,

(2) The records from investigations of Jason Van Dyke, Thomas Gaffney, Joseph Walsh, David March.  These are Chicago police officers involved in the Laquan McDonald shooting and have all been tried in state court.  I'm looking for records from any investigations of these officers, though, not just related to the McDonald shooting.  You can limit this to records in which these people were the subject of an investigation and need not do a cross-reference search.

(3) The records from investigations of the Chicago Police Department as an entity.  This request number 3 is not looking for records of investigations into individual officers, but investigations into the entity itself, or the City of Chicago as an entity for things related to the police department.

Please note that under binding case law, non-human entities like CPD have no privacy rights under FOIA.

Perlo left government service in 1947, when his loyalty was called into question during an investigation by the House Unamerican Activities Committee. Perlo denied allegations that he had spied for the Soviet Union. A dedicated Communist, Victor Perlo headed the Perlo group of Soviet espionage agents in the United States. Before World War II, Perlo had been a member of the Ware spy ring. The Perlo ring included several important U.S. officials, including a Senate staff director, and the ring supplied the Soviet Union with economic, political, and military intelligence, including United States aircraft production figures. Perlo infiltrated through the United States Department of Commerce in 1938 to gather economic intelligence, and passed on intelligence concerning basic economic decisions he presented to Harry Hopkins, Secretary of Commerce. He transferred to the Division of Monetary Research, and served under Harry Dexter White, followed by Frank Coe and Harold Glasser, all of whom were later found to be Soviet agents.
