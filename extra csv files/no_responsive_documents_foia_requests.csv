Please find attached an obituary as proof of death.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.",1377643-000,False,1467,1365,,,0.00,2017-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,2017-07-10,2017-09-13 00:00:00+00:00,adam-west-38629

If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

Not that he had any secrets to spill or would ever betray any if he did.  But Dzikansky had a drinking problem, and in a country where Israeli intelligence agents regularly try to recruit their CIA counterparts, an NYPD officer could be a useful pawn.

On the American Patrol website and in self-produced videos, the group rails against Mexican immigrants, accusing them of bringing to the U.S. crime, drugs and squalor and of practicing “immigration via the birth canal.” Mexicans, in the words of group founder Glenn Spencer, are a “cultural cancer” following a secret plan, the Plan de Aztlán, to complete “la reconquista” (the reconquest, or takeover) of the American Southwest, which was once controlled by Spain and/or Mexico.

Glenn Spencer, one of the harder line anti-immigrant ideologues now operating, founded Voice of Citizens Together (VCT, which is more commonly known, like one of his websites and his radio show, as American Patrol) in 1992. According to a 2005 article in LA Weekly, Spencer claims that the sight of “Mexicans” in the Rodney King riots “tearing down [his] old neighborhood” prompted him to start Valley Citizens Together as a way to bring attention to the growing threat of illegal immigration. The name was later changed to Voice of Citizens Together to broaden the group’s appeal. Later, the American Patrol (AP) name was added; today, that name is much more commonly used than Voice of Citizens Together.

Riding a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment, Spencer led VCT/AP into a loose federation of groups under the banner of “Save Our State” to lobby for the passage of California's Proposition 187, which would have denied educational and other benefits to illegal immigrants and their children. Although it passed in 1994, Prop 187 was stalled for years in the courts and effectively killed in 1998 by the incoming Gov. Gray Davis.
 
It was later that year that VCT/AP — along with Barbara Coe’s hard-line California Coalition for Immigration Reform (CCIR) and the better-known Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR)— began working with the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens  (CCC). Coe, Spencer and Rick Oltman, then FAIR’s western regional representative, all came to Cullman, Ala., to speak at a 1998 anti-immigrant rally hosted by the CCC, a group that regularly spews vitriol at black people (“a retrograde species of humanity”). Also attending was an unrobed Alabama Klansman. The event, held to protest a swelling population of Mexican workers in the region, ended with the arrest of one of the rally’s organizers, charged with violating a local ordinance regulating outdoor fires by burning a Mexican flag. It was seen as an early indicator of the mixing of white supremacists and other extremists with more “mainstream” nativist elements.

VCT/AP uses its website, American Patrol Report, and self-produced videos like “Treachery and Treason in America” and “Conquest of Aztlán” to vilify Mexicans, deride so-called fifth-column Latinos, and rant about the allegedly long-planned Mexican invasion of the American Southwest. On the site, Spencer attacked Mario Obledo, a leading Latino activist and recent recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, as “Pinche [a slang Spanish term often translated as “worthless” or “fucking”] Cockroach and 1998 Asshole of the Year.” A cartoon character was depicted urinating on Obledo’s picture. (Bizarrely, Spencer later denied to reporters that the site had ever carried such a caricature.) Spencer posts material on his site from such men as H. Millard, an infamous columnist for the racist Council of Conservative Citizens who once bemoaned the “slimy brown mass of glop” that immigration and interracial families were making of the U.S. population.

VCT/AP’s videos push racist, anti-Latino conspiracy theories. Its video, “Immigration: Threatening the Bonds of Our Union,” which was sent to every member of Congress, purports to prove that the Mexican government and Mexican-Americans are conspiring to take over the American Southwest and create the nation of Aztlán. “Some scoff at the idea of a Mexican plan of conquest,” says the video (which also features a scuffle between VCT and anti-racist activists). The video then proceeds with an assortment of sound bites from Latino activists and Mexican officials — including references to “la reconquista” — that “prove” that there is a Mexican plot to break the Southwestern states away. A “hostile force on our border,” the narrator warns in grim tones, is engaging in “demographic war” against the United States. “Mexico is moving to capture the American Southwest.”

Under the banner of America Patrol, Spencer also ran a weekly radio show that aired in several cities in the late 1990s. On it, he hosted a series of extremist guests, including Kevin MacDonald, a California professor who accuses Jews of pursuing an immigration policy specifically intended to dilute and weaken the white population of America.

Thanks to groups like VCT/AP, variations of the Aztlán conspiracy theory are now widespread on the American radical right and in the much larger nativist movement. Columnists like Sam Francis, the late editor of the Council of Conservative Citizens’ Citizen Informer, have spread the theory throughout the radical right. And MSNBC news commentator and close Francis friend Pat Buchanan, a white nationalist, has helped to more widely publicize variations of the theory, as have other “mainstream” commentators like CNN’s Lou Dobbs.

In 2002, Spencer abandoned California for Cochise County, Ariz., joining several other anti-immigrant activists including Minuteman co-founder Chris Simcox, who have relocated to the southern border. (In a 2003 essay, “White Fight or Flight,” Spencer suggested that white people “should get out of California — now, before it is too late to salvage the equity they have in their homes and the value of their businesses.”) Setting up operations in the Pueblo del Sol subdivision in Sierra Vista, Ariz., Spencer created American Border Patrol (ABP), a private organization that would serve as a “shadow Border Patrol.” (Although it has its own website, ABP is essentially an Arizona extension of his California group, VCT/AP.) Using high-tech sensors, infrared video-cameras mounted on model airplanes, and “citizens” roaming the often mountainous terrain on ATVs, Spencer’s operation was designed to embarrass the federal government into fully militarizing the border by capturing images of undocumented workers on film and uploading them to the American Border Patrol website for all to see.

In 1979, a 17-year-old boy, Scott Cantrell, shot himself in the head in Pallenberg's bed with a gun owned by Keith Richards, while at the South Salem, New York house shared by Richards and Pallenberg. The youth had been employed as a part-time groundsman at the estate and was involved in a sexual relationship with Pallenberg. Richards was in Paris recording with the Rolling Stones, but his son was at the house when the teen killed himself. Pallenberg was arrested; however, the death was ruled a suicide in 1980, despite rumours that Pallenberg and Cantrell had been playing a game of Russian roulette. The police investigation stated that Pallenberg was not on the same floor of the house at the time the fatal shot was fired.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.

Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.

Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.

As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.","1425682-000, DOJ-AP-2019-002802",False,903,771,,,0.00,2018-12-26 03:22:12.575954+00:00,2019-01-24,2019-05-07 15:20:26.429538+00:00,anonsec-nasa-hoax-federal-bureau-of-investigation-66572

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.",1368667-000,False,1576,1311,,bilderberg,0.00,2017-02-21 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-21,2017-11-13 00:00:00+00:00,arthur-taylor-33666

She organized the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) from 1958 to 1963, edited the national DOB magazine The Ladder from 1963–66, and worked closely with Frank Kameny in the 1960s on the first picket lines that brought attention to the ban on employment of gay people by the largest employer in the US at that time: the United States government. Her early experiences with trying to learn more about lesbianism fueled her lifetime work with libraries. In the 1970s, Gittings was most involved in the American Library Association, especially its gay caucus, the first such in a professional organization, in order to promote positive literature about homosexuality in libraries. She was a part of the movement to get the American Psychiatric Association to drop homosexuality as a mental illness in 1972. Her self-described life mission was to tear away the ""shroud of invisibility"" related to homosexuality, which had theretofore been associated with crime and mental illness.

Founded by Willis Carto in 1994, The Barnes Review (TBR) is one of the most virulent anti-Semitic organizations around. Its flagship journal, The Barnes Review, and its website, Barnesreview.org, are dedicated to historical revisionism and Holocaust denial. The organization is also a moneymaking enterprise. Besides journal subscriptions, its TBR Book Club and online bookstore promote and sell a wide range of extremist books and publications. The Barnes Review also hosts nearly annual conferences that attract an international crowd of antigovernment extremists, anti-Semites, white supremacists, and racist conspiracy theorists.

Named after Harry Elmer Barnes, a prominent 20th-century anti-Semite and Holocaust denier, The Barnes Review was created by Willis Carto, who also founded the extreme right-wing Liberty Lobby and the Institute for Historical Review (IHR), another Holocaust denial organization. Carto created The Barnes Review as a rival to IHR after he was forced out by the IHR's leadership in 1993 for financial mismanagement. 

Claiming that its mission is to ""tell the whole about history,"" TBR really practices an extremist form of revisionist history that includes defending the Nazi regime, denying the Holocaust, discounting the evils of slavery, and promoting white nationalism. The Barnes Review magazine has published articles entitled ""Adolf Hitler — An Overlooked Candidate for the Nobel Prize?"", ""Treblinka Was No Death Camp"", ""Is There a Negro Race?"", ""‘Reconquista': The Mexican Plan to Take the Southwest"", and ""David Duke: An Awakening."" The Barnes Review, like most of the radical-right institutions started by Willis Carto over the decades, also gives voice to any number of wild conspiracy theories. TBR's website puts it like this to its readers: ""Many intelligent Americans still believe Pearl Harbor was a ‘surprise attack.' It was not. ... Many still believe Columbus (or Leif Ericsson) was first to America. He was not. ... Or what about proof that there was federal foreknowledge and complicity in the OKC bombing? There was. We can't even begin to discuss here the many questions that have never been answered about 9-11. The list of historical lies and distortions goes on and on and on. . .""

Besides serving Carto's ideological and propaganda purposes, much of this ""historical"" work also serves to raise money.  Annual subscriptions to the bimonthly journal are $46.  Recommended works by the TBR Book Club, including Cultural Insurrections: Essays on Western Civilization, Jewish Influence & Anti-Semitism and March of Titans: A History of the White Race, can be purchased at TBR's online bookstore. Advertising space is for sale. There is even a ""TBR Distributor Program"" that will pay people for recruiting new subscribers to the TBR journal. The ad does its best to entice potential collaborators: ""But before you say you can't afford it or it's too much work, look how easy — and how profitable — we've made it.""  

The Barnes Review's nearly annual conferences also provide an opportunity to market TBR's materials and ideology — and are nonsectarian in regards to all manner of extremism. In past years, paying attendees could listen to lectures by longtime anti-Semite Eustace Mullins, antigovernment conspiracy-monger (and former FBI official) Ted Gunderson, and neo-Nazi Alex Hassinger, who runs Nordwave, a Florida group that calls itself ""The Voice of National Socialism."" Hutton Gibson, an anti-Semitic ""radical traditionalist Catholic"" and the father of actor Mel Gibson's, was extremely popular during the 2003 conference. 

Even some more supposedly mainstream individuals have participated in what is really a Willis Carto show. William Lind of the Free Congress Foundation, a far-right outfit headed by Paul Weyrich (one of the founders of the Moral Majority), gave a speech at the 2002 conference. Although he told his audience that his Free Congress Foundation was ""not among those who question whether the Holocaust occurred,"" he went on to lay blame for ""political correctness"" and other evils on so-called ""cultural Marxists,"" who turned out to be the same folks Carto blames for America's ills. ""These guys,"" Lind explained, ""were all Jewish.""

There is also an international presence at many of these conferences. For example, Arthur Kemp, a notorious South African white supremacist tied to the U.S. neo-Nazi group National Alliance who was once accused of helping plan a major terrorist assassination in his home country, spoke in 2006. 

More recently, The Barnes Review has begun promoting Christian Identity, a radical theology that claims that Jews are the literal descendants of Satan, on its website and in its journal. The article ""Christian Identity: American's Best Hope?"" appeared in the January/February 2008 issue of The Barnes Review, and Carto personally posted to its website the article, ""Is Christianity Relevant?"" The article outlined Carto's belief that ""the Identity message holds out the hope for survival — not only spiritual and cultural survival — but racial survival.""

History:
American investors from Mobile, Alabama, incorporated the Bank of British Honduras in 1902, and it commenced operations in 1903. In 1912 Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) bought the bank and proceeded to operate it as a branch.

In 1987, RBC sold the bank to an investment group headed by Lord Ashcroft as Belize Holdings, Inc., then Carlisle Holdings, then Belize Bank Holdings; the new owners renamed the bank, ""Belize Bank"".

In 2000, Belize Bank established Belize Bank (Turks and Caicos) - ""Belize Bank (TCI)."" As a result of expanding Caribbean business, in February 2009, Belize Bank Ltd, changed its name to British Caribbean Bank Ltd.

Belize Bank (BB) is the first, oldest continuing, and largest bank in Belize. It has over BZ$825 million in assets (2007) and BZ$182 million of capital reserves (2007). Its network of 13 branches covers the entire country. BB has a 44% market share in loans and 38% market share in deposits. It maintains an international banking subsidiary in the Turks and Caicos Islands.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.",1368246-000,False,1577,1307,,bilderberg,0.00,2017-02-20 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-20,2017-11-17 00:00:00+00:00,bernhard-33637

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.",1377547-000,False,1467,1273,Freedom of LGBTQIA+ Information,,0.00,2017-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,2017-07-10,2017-12-21 00:00:00+00:00,blake-brockington-38654

Howard was an important figure in the modern LGBT rights movement.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

ASankin,Communications With The Government Accountability Institute (Federal Bureau of Investigation),No Responsive Documents,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/communications-with-the-government-accountability-institute-federal-bureau-of-investigation-33414/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Dear Sir or Madam,

I am a journalist working for the Center for Investigative Reporting (henceforth “CIR”), a nonprofit news organization. I am requesting records under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. 5 U.S.C.§ 552.

Request:

I am seeking all records concerning communications between this agency and the Government Accountability Institute (henceforth “GAI”) (www.g-a-i.org).

My request encompasses email messages and other forms of correspondence, in addition to records reflecting any contact this agency has had with GAI since its founding in 2012. Emails from GAI may come from, but are not limited to, email addresses on the @g-a-i.org domain. I would also like all communications containing the keyword “Government Accountability Institute.”

Please remove duplicate records and Google alerts from the results of this request.

Background:

GAI is a 501(c)(3) organization founded in 2012 by American novelist Peter Schwiezer and Stephen K. Bannon. Schwiezer, a former consult to the Office of Presidential Speechwriting at the White House, is the author of the book ""Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How Foreign Governments and Businesses made Bill and Hillary Rich"". Bannon, the former chief executive of Breitbart News, is the current Chief Strategist to the President Donald Trump. He also holds a principal position on the president’s National Security Council (hereafter “NSC”).

Accordingly, I seek to understand the past and current relationship between the Government Accountability Institute and this agency.

Fee Waiver:

CIR (revealnews.org) is both a nonprofit news organization, an online news organization, and the producer of a popular public radio show/podcast called Reveal. Under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), I am entitled to a fee waiver on the grounds that disclosure of the information sought is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. 

Regardless, CIR is willing to pay fees for this request up to $10 without prior approval. If you estimate that the fees will exceed this limit, please notify me first.

Expedited Processing:

The subject of this request is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity, which affects public confidence. 28 C.F.R. § 16.5(d)(1)(iv). The release of these records will significantly contribute to the public understanding of how Mr. Bannon is advising the president on exigent matters of national security. 

Due to ongoing concerns over Mr. Bannon’s role on the NSC, as well has his input on all policy coming out of the executive branch, any responsive records are of timely value. The requested documents are integral to a breaking news story and, therefore, any delay in the documents release would compromise a significant recognized interest. 

CIR is an organization “primarily engaged in disseminating information.” Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Department of Justice, 321 F. Supp. 2d 24, 29 n.5 (D.D.C. 2004) (finding that CIR is a “representative of the news media” because it “gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw material into distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience.”)

The D.C. Circuit Court has stated that in determining whether there is an urgency to inform the public about government activity, and thus a compelling need to exigent disclosure, three factors are relevant: “(1) whether the request concerns a matter of current exigency to the American public; (2) whether the consequences of delaying a response would compromise a significant recognized interest; and (3) whether the request concerns federal government activity.” Al-Fayed v. CIA, 254 F.3d 306 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (“Al-Fayed”)

In Wadelton v. Department of State, 13-0412 ESH, 2013 WL 1760853 (D.D.C. Apr. 25, 2013), the District Court in the D.C. Circuit noted that “courts have found a ‘compelling need’ to exist when the subject matter of the request was central to a pressing issue of the day.”

Additionally, “compelling need” is defined by the first tier of 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E)(v) as information the delayed release of which “could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.” 

As it is the responsibility of NSC members to advise the president on the inclusion of U.S. citizens on so-called “kill or capture lists,” Mr. Bannon is a unique position to advise and persuade the president of the United States to authorize lethal force against Americans overseas. — See: Hosenball, Mark. (2011, Oct 5). Reuters. Secret panel can put Americans on ‘kill list’. Retrieved from: http://reut.rs/2jLLavO. 

Due to the reasons I have described, I believe this matter is at the very heart of the “urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity"" standard. U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); See also: Al-Fayed at 306.

Other supporting news articles: 

U.S. Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy (D-Florida) has introduced legislation (H.R. 804) which would bar the president of the United States from appointing aides who primarily serve a political role as a principal member of the National Security Council. — Rep. Sires, Albio. (2017, Feb. 8). New Jersey Online. Bannon's appointment to National Security Council is reckless. Retrieved from http://bit.ly/2lzkRKE.

“President Trump was reportedly not fully briefed on the executive order he signed that allowed his chief strategist Steve Bannon a seat at the meetings of the country’s top national security efforts.” — Associated Press contributed. (2017, Feb. 6). Fox News. Report: Trump not fully briefed on exec order that gave Bannon seat at NSC meetings. Retrieved from http://fxn.ws/2leKI9B. 

“Putting aside for a moment Mr. Bannon’s troubling public positions, which are worrisome enough, institutionalizing his attendance threatens to politicize national security decision making.” — Mullen, Michael G. (2017, Feb. 6) The New York Times. I Was on the National Security Council. Bannon Doesn't Belong There. Retrieved from http://nyti.ms/2lsHL9B. 

I expect a response to my request for expedited processing within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. 

Certification:

The above information is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Electronic Records:

Please furnish all responsive records in electronic format.

Further Correspondence:

All correspondence regarding this request can be directed to me at asankin@revealnews.org.  

Please be aware that under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A), a FOIA request is considered constructively denied after twenty business days and is subject to an appeal on that basis. If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the act. As the law requires, I will also expect you to release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt exempt material. 

I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 786-0793.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.

Compton's Cafeteria was one of a chain of cafeterias, owned by Gene Compton, in San Francisco from the 1940s to the 1970s. The Tenderloin location of Compton's at 101 Taylor Street (at Turk)—open from 1954 to 1972—was one of the few places where transgender people could congregate publicly in the city, because they were unwelcome in gay bars, due to transphobia within the LGBT Community at this time. In addition, the cafeteria was open all hours until the riots occurred. Most of the fights occurred from 2-3 am so they were forced to close at midnight. Because cross-dressing was illegal at the time, police could use the presence of transgender people in a bar as a pretext for making a raid and closing the bar. Many of the militant hustlers and street queens involved in the riot were members of Vanguard, the first known gay youth organization in the United States, which had been organized earlier that year with the help of radical ministers working with Glide Memorial Church, a center for progressive social activism in the Tenderloin for many years. A lesbian group of street people was also formed called the Street Orphans. 

In the 1960s the Compton’s Cafeteria staff began to call the police to crack down on transgender individuals, who would frequent the restaurant. In response to police arrests, the transgender community launched a picket of Compton’s Cafeteria. Although the picket was unsuccessful, it was one of the first demonstrations against police violence directed towards transgender people in San Francisco. On the first night of the riot, the management of Compton's called the police when some transgender customers became raucous. In the 50's and 60's police officers were known to mistreat transgender people.[7] When one of these known officers attempted to arrest one of the trans women, she threw her coffee in his face. At that point the riot began, dishes and furniture were thrown, and the restaurant's plate-glass windows were smashed. Police called for reinforcements as the fighting spilled into the street, where a police car had all its windows broken out and a sidewalk newsstand was burned down. The exact date of the riot is unknown because 1960 police records no longer exist and the riot was not covered by newspapers.

The next night, more transgender people, hustlers, Tenderloin street people, and other members of the LGBT community joined in a picket of the cafeteria, which would not allow transgender people back in. The demonstration ended with the newly installed plate-glass windows being smashed again.",1377370-000,False,1467,1294,Freedom of LGBTQIA+ Information,lgbt,0.00,2017-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,2017-07-10,2017-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,comptons-cafeteria-riot-38637

Spence (1941 – November 10, 1989) was a Republican lobbyist who was found dead in a Ritz-Carlton hotel room in 1989.

Spence's name came to national prominence in the aftermath of a June 28, 1989 article in the Washington Times identifying Spence as a customer of a homosexual escort service being investigated by the Secret Service, the District of Columbia Police and the United States Attorney's Office for suspected credit card fraud. The newspaper said he spent as much as $20,000 a month on the service. He had also been linked to a White House guard who has said he accepted an expensive watch from Mr. Spence and allowed him and friends to take late-night White House tours.

Spence entered a downward spiral in the wake of the Washington Times exposé, increasingly involving himself with call boys and crack, and culminating in his July 31, 1989 arrest at the Barbizon Hotel on East 63rd St in Manhattan for criminal possession of a firearm and criminal possession of cocaine.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.",1377503-000,False,1467,1294,Freedom of LGBTQIA+ Information,,0.00,2017-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,2017-07-10,2017-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,craig-rodwell-38656

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.",1377949-000,False,1467,1234,Freedom of LGBTQIA+ Information,,0.00,2017-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,2017-07-10,2018-01-29 00:00:00+00:00,david-brill-38653

My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established.

The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.

Proof of death: This individual is listed as dead in the FBI's Dead List, which also confirms the existence of the file. Per FBI standards and regulations, an FBI file is acceptable proof of death. For your convenience, a copy of the list may be found at https://archive.org/details/FBIRIDsDeadList2015

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.","1368625-000, DOJ-AP-2017-004047",False,1575,1482,,"clinton,hillary clinton",0.00,2017-02-22 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-22,2017-05-26 00:00:00+00:00,dorothy-rodham-33817

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers.

In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.

Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act. I hereby request the following records:

Any and all documents that the Federal Bureau of Investigations has regarding Edgar Cayce (1877-1945), a well-known psychic medium  and mystic, also known as the""sleeping prophet.""

I am interested to learn whether and, if so, to what extent the FBI investigated Edgar Cayce's claims regarding reincarnation, the afterlife, and the Akashic records. 

FOIA case law establishes the extent to which agencies MUST search all records systems reasonably believed to contain responsive documents, even if it means contacting former employees. The Justice Department's May 2004 Guide states that an agency ""cannot limit its search to only one record system if there are others that are likely to turn up the information requested.""

The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

This was a hijacking of a commercial airliner flying between Tbilisi and Leningrad by a number of culturally prominent Georgians who were attempting to defect from the Soviet Union. The hijacking was unsuccessful, and the plane never left Soviet airspace. All of the hijackers were tried and executed following the hijacking. The incident has been dramatized in literature, theater and film numerous times in recent years in the country of Georgia, and opinions of the incident serve as a sort of litmus test regarding opinions toward the Soviet Union. The release of any documents, should they exist, would benefit the study of contemporary Georgian history, and a show of openness regarding the incident would not be harmful (and in fact would probably be helpful) for the relationship between the US and Georgia.

Please search for records held by the Los Angeles and Albuquerque field offices, in addition to the Santa Fe satellite office. Of particular interest would be records held in relation to his work in Hollywood in the late 1950s and 1960s. It is likely that there could be documents related to Max Evans in relation to his personal and professional relationship with the film director Sam Peckinpah. Peckinpah made films that were criticized for their extreme violence an he is purported to have led a personal life fraught with substance abuse problems characterized as excessive even by Hollywood standards. Mr. Evans published a book about his experiences working on a film with Peckinpah. 

Per advice on the internet, it is recommended to state that, ""your agency is required to search the physical records stored at NARA’s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency’s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8"" 

Therefore, please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, Maryland, for records related to Max Evans.

Rick Carp,FBI: The Order of Nine Angles,No Responsive Documents,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/fbi-the-order-of-nine-angles-61687/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"A copy of FBI (or Homeland Security/domestic terrorism research) files on the Order of Nine Angles and the Noctulians. 

The Order of Nine Angles is a secretive Satanist/Occultist group, which comes from the United Kingdom. But here in the United States, this sect is gaining ideological ground through extremist political ideologies. 
For example, the dangerous neo-Nazi organization the Atomwaffen Division, promotes the work of the ONA as required reading. ONA publishes their works with Martinet Press and the books are often authored under the name Tempel ov Blood, which wrote the book Iron Gates that Atomwaffen makes its new members read through. The Satanic influence on some of these fascists has caused a stir within the far-right milieu. (See: https://www.thedailybeast.com/satanism-drama-is-tearing-apart-the-murderous-neo-nazi-group-atomwaffen) 

But that is the far-right. The post-leftist Eco-Extremist types from the Atassa journal also appear to be reading Iron Gates as well. They had a book review on their Facebook page, which appears to be taken down or a closed Facebook group now.

One of the requirements for neophyte members rising through the ranks of the ONA is to spend time within different sectors of society learning new skills -- such as joining the police force, becoming a soldier, or working as a fringe political organizer. Many fascist groups recommend joining the military and whatnot in order to gain tactical skills for a future racial holy war. (See: Previous reporting on Atomwaffen or other far-right groups ties to military: https://www.propublica.org/article/atomwaffen-division-hate-group-active-duty-military). Similarly, an article in the Atassa journal described the importance of the Double Life -- living as a regular, nondescript member of society, but preparing for war against industrial civilization.

What are we seeing here whereby a relatively unknown occultist group is influencing the most extreme fringes on both sides of the political spectrum? These groups all follow accelerationist ideologies, i.e., exacerbate all forms of social disorder from fights about racism to causing environmental damage in order to hasten/bring about a total collapse of society (or at least a slight breakdown, which can provide an opening for their attacks).

Has the FBI looked into anything about the ONA during previous cultural scares about things like Satanism or the occult (ala the 1980's freakouts over stupid things like Dungeons & Dragons)? 
The FBI appears to be researching the modern fascist groups like Atomwaffen (who are linked to at least five murders) and the FBI has watched radical environmentalists for ages (""The Green Scare"" etc.), but are there any documents available about historical (or modern) occultist links to extreme political movements, or documents related to the Order of Nine Angles in particular, or anything about right-wing leaders in this milieu such as David Myatt?

Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. My primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.",1407185-000,False,1134,1003,,,0.00,2018-05-09 05:27:24.737542+00:00,2018-06-07,2018-09-17 19:12:34.986488+00:00,foia-portal-media-files-53541

He owned a home at 30 Collamore Terrace, West Orange, NJ where he founded the Log Cabin Chess Club (1934-1960). In February 1956, he hosted a US contingent in a chess tournament in Cuba which included future World Champion Bobby Fischer, his mother Regina Fischer, and Norman Tweed Whitaker. Lauck’s death from cardiac arrest while playing in a chess tournament July 31, 1965 during the US Open Chess Championship in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico was widely reported in the chess world.

jkatzmd,FOIA Request for Elliott Forry Laucks,No Responsive Documents,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/foia-request-for-elliott-forry-laucks-61546/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"A copy of FBI files on Elliott Forry Laucks (other last names from family crest include Lauks, Laucks, Lauk, Loucks, Loux, Louck, Loucks, Lauck) who was born in or near York, Pennsylvania in 1898. He graduated from Gov. Dummer Academy in Massachusetts and Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire. He moved to West Orange, New Jersey in 1934 with his wife Josephine, and son Barry and daughter June. A copy of the 1940 census is attached. During the 1930s, he expressed his sympathies for Nazi Germany and became involved with the German-American bund. He wore a swastika lapel pin and expressed his pro-Nazi sentiments until he died in 1965. He built a house at 30 Collamore Terrace in West Orange New Jersey. The house was unique in that it had an observatory that faced east towards New York City, and a basement that was finished to resemble a hunting cabin including bunk beds and Adirondack chairs made from tree limbs. He was a chess grandmaster and christened the basement room the Log Cabin Chess Club. A picture of Mr. Loucks under the chess club banner is attached. Due to his largess and sponsorship of individuals and chess tournaments, the Log Cabin Chess Club became renowned in the United States.  He became a sponsor of Bobby Fischer, the future world champion when Fischer was 13 in 1956. He also gave money to Fischer's mother Regina, paid for Fischer's entry fees, and gave him free membership in the Log Cabin Chess Club. 

He was the son of S. Forry Laucks, owner of York Safe and Lock, located in York Pennsylvania. During World War II, York Safe and Lock supplied Bofors Naval cannons and 5-inch gun mounts to the U.S. Navy, and fuses and explosives to all branches of the military. The father died in 1942. At the end of World War II, Eliot Ness, of FBI fame as the leader of the “Untouchables”, was chairman of the board of the Diebold Corporation, which purchased York Safe and Lock, and later liquidated the remaining assets of York Safe and Lock. Elliott Loucks was the sole surviving heir to his father’s assets including York Safe and Lock.  What relationship the pro-Nazi Elliott Loucks had to his father, a crucial defense contractor, or to Mr. Ness, the liquidator of his father’s principal assets, is conjecture that the FBI files could illuminate.

In February 1956, Laucks  hosted a US contingent that traveled to a chess tournament in Cuba at the height of the Cold War. The group included future World Champion Bobby Fischer, age 13, his mother Regina Fischer, Laucks, Glen Herbst, and Norman Tweed Whitaker. Regina Fischer had been under FBI surveillance as a labor organizer and pro-communist since 1946, as revealed in the 750 page  FOIA document released by the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2002. Whitaker was a chess grandmaster, as well as a convicted car thief, extortionist in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, and a child molester who had been imprisoned in Alcatraz where he was a Known Associate of Al Capone. Whitaker was a frequent guest at the West Orange house and played in tournaments there. Loucks had been financing the Fishers for nearly 2 years at that point. The trip was quite public, and the conclusion – the Americans lost to the Cubans – was covered in the New York Times. Hard to believe that a group that included an American Nazi, a known child molester in the presence of a young boy, and a communist sympathizer already under FBI surveillance did not attract the Bureau’s attention, if not directly, then in cross-referenced files.

Loucks continued to preside over the Log Cabin Chess Club, travel and played in numerous tournaments. However, in 1960, Loucks suddenly dissolved the Log Cabin Chess Club, sold the house and departed West Orange amid allegations of child molestation concerning the house manager, Alexander John Goodman (Gudding). Goodman was later identified by the Boy Scouts for having inappropriate contact with a nine year old on a camping trip. However, law enforcement was not contacted. Boy Scout documents are attached.

Lauck’s death from cardiac arrest while playing in a chess tournament July 31, 1965, during the US Open Chess Championship in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico was widely reported. See attached obituary.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

Proof of death is not required as the death is widely and extensively known, common knowledge and widely reported by the mainstream media. Further, his death is reflected in the FBI's RIDS Dead List. Per the FBI website, an FBI file is acceptable proof of death.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.",1366613-000,False,1598,1408,,,0.00,2017-01-30 05:00:00+00:00,2017-02-28,2017-08-08 00:00:00+00:00,fred-koremutsu-32649

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.",1377490-000,False,1467,1289,Freedom of LGBTQIA+ Information,,0.00,2017-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,2017-07-10,2017-12-05 00:00:00+00:00,harvey-milk-high-school-38657

The car crashed at high speed in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel, with only bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones surviving.

There have been many conspiracy theories surrounding the car crash. However, British and French police investigations put the blame largely on Paul for being affected by alcohol and prescription drugs, and later driving recklessly.

Proof of death: This individual is listed as dead in the FBI's Dead List, which also confirms the existence of the file. Per FBI standards and regulations, an FBI file is acceptable proof of death. For your convenience, a copy of the list may be found at https://archive.org/details/FBIRIDsDeadList2015

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.","1368666-000, DOJ-AP-2019-007337",False,1576,495,,bilderberg,0.00,2017-02-21 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-21,2020-02-07 15:34:58.009170+00:00,holbrooke-33664

Proof of death: This individual is listed as dead in the FBI's Dead List, which also confirms the existence of the file. Per FBI standards and regulations, an FBI file is acceptable proof of death. For your convenience, a copy of the list may be found at https://archive.org/details/FBIRIDsDeadList2015

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.","1368624-000, DOJ-AP-2017-003603",False,1575,1492,,"clinton,hillary clinton",0.00,2017-02-22 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-22,2017-05-16 00:00:00+00:00,hugh-rodham-33818

EmmaBest,Institute for Historical Review (IHR),No Responsive Documents,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/institute-for-historical-review-ihr-31231/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning theInstitute for Historical Review (IHR). Founded in 1978 by Willis Carto, a longtime anti-Semite, the Institute for Historical Review (IHR) is a pseudo-academic organization that claims to seek ""truth and accuracy in history,"" but whose real purpose is to promote Holocaust denial and defend Nazism.

In 1978, Willis Carto, founder and head of the anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby, based in Washington, D.C., spun off a new organization called the Institute for Historical Review (IHR). It presented itself as a legitimate historical research group, devoted to ""revisionism"" — a term hijacked from a school of credible historians who offered new interpretations for the origins of World War I. But in fact, it was made up of white supremacists and neo-Nazis, and it would draw expertise from the like-minded around the world. Its mission was to erase the Holocaust by any means at its disposal — including distortion, misquotation and outright falsification.

IHR's first annual conference in 1979 attracted deniers from around the world and helped to introduce some key American extremists to Holocaust denial. David Duke, the neo-Nazi who was then the national leader of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was so taken with the idea that he followed up the conference with a ""Special Holocaust Edition"" of his Crusader newspaper. In the same way, National Socialist Party of America leader Frank Collin enthusiastically embraced denial, saying, ""There was no Holocaust, but they deserve one — and will get it."" For years, IHR's yearly conferences were key events that offered networking opportunities for neo-Nazis and anti-Semites from around the world.

A critical contribution by IHR was the pseudo-academic gloss it applied to its anti-Semitism. The group actively tried to avoid blatant anti-Jewish slurs, and instead sought to couch its politics in distortions of history and science meant to sound reasonable. Though the theories that resulted were far out, they had at least the appearance of legitimacy, as did The Journal of Historical Review that the IHR began to publish in 1980. Deniers would claim, for example, that the Anne Frank diary is a fraud because it contained marks made with a postwar ballpoint pen (they didn't mention that the marks were made later by Frank's father, who survived German concentration camps to edit and publish the diary). They would assert that the death-camp ovens were not capable of burning as many bodies as the Allies had said were disposed of after gassing. They lied about the qualities of the Zyklon B gas used to kill Jews, the operation of the Einsatzgruppen (the mobile killing squads which shot to death more than 1 million Jews in Eastern Europe), and hundreds of other facts. Through it all, IHR sought to give the appearance that its writers were honest, if skeptical, students of history.

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, IHR hosted conferences that attracted various well-known Holocaust deniers from around the world: Ernst Zündel and John Ball of Canada (Zündel was later deported by Canada to his native Germany); Robert Faurisson of France; Friedrich Berg of Germany; Carlo Mattogno of Italy; and Jürgen Graf and Arthur Vogt of Switzerland. Most notably, David Irving, a writer whose Holocaust denial activities caused a British judge to label him ""a right-wing, pro-Nazi polemicist,"" attended in 1983, and went on to speak before at least four more conferences, in 1989, 1990, 1992, 1994, as well as at numerous other IHR events. 

While outwardly thriving during this period, internally there was a power struggle going on for control of IHR. In the mid-1980s, Mark Weber, a former news editor of National Vanguard, a neo-Nazi publication of the National Alliance, began taking a leading role at Willis Carto's IHR. In 1984, Weber began leading the group's annual conferences, and the next year he joined the IHR's editorial advisory committee; in 1992, he took over IHR's The Journal of Historical Review. In 1993, with Weber's support, the IHR board ousted Carto as its leader, accusing him of interfering in editorial decisions. The following May, Carto and his wife tried to retake IHR by occupying its California offices, a situation that led to fistfights and Carto being forcefully removed by the police. Around the same time, another dispute between IHR and Carto broke out, with IHR leaders accusing Carto of diverting some $10 million that was allegedly left to IHR's parent body, the Legion for the Survival of Freedom. 

During the decade of litigation that followed, Carto's The Spotlight, the newspaper published by his Liberty Lobby, characterized Weber as a ""rat,"" ""cockroach"" and ""devil,"" but in the end Weber's side basically won. In 1996, a California court ruled in favor of IHR, saying that Carto owed the Legion for the Survival of Freedom $6.43 million. In 2001, The Spotlight was shut down, although it was rapidly replaced with the look-alike American Free Press, which like its predecessor focused on the alleged evils of ""Zionism,"" wild-eyed conspiracy theories, and wacky alternative health claims. Carto also created The Barnes Review, a new Holocaust denial journal that competed directly with IHR.

While Weber and the IHR won their lawsuits, the fight with Carto proved to be a great distraction for the organization. It could not regularly publish the bimonthly The Journal of Historical Review (no issues were published between April 1996 and May 1997) and it was unable to hold any conferences between 1994 and 2000. IHR did manage to put on a major conference in 2000, with Irving, Zündel, and other notable Holocaust deniers in attendance, but a planned 2001 conference on ""Revisionism and Zionism"" in Beirut, Lebanon, was cancelled after the host government ""would not permit the four-day meeting to take place."" 

Since then, the IHR has continued to decline. By 2003, it had stopped publishing its journal and its once-large conferences were reduced to mostly small, one-day affairs with a couple of speakers. A major blow came in 2009 when Weber decided to downgrade Holocaust denial in favor of criticizing Jews and Israel. Weber was viciously attacked by several important revisionists, many of whom called for his resignation from IHR. Weber still speaks in public and on radio shows such as ""The Political Cesspool,"" which is run by white nationalist James Edwards of Memphis, Tenn. IHR also still maintains its website and continues to sell extremist books, but it is clearly a shadow of its former self. 

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.",1363812-000,False,1636,1072,Haters: Documenting Extremist and Hate Groups,,0.00,2016-12-23 05:00:00+00:00,2017-01-25,2018-07-10 04:56:00+00:00,institute-for-historical-review-ihr-31231

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such.

BACKGROUND

Jonathan James Bush (May 6, 1931 – May 5, 2021) was an American banker, the brother of George H. W. Bush and uncle of George W. Bush and Jeb Bush.

Bush was born in Greenwich, Connecticut, to Prescott Sheldon Bush, a politician, and Dorothy Walker Bush. He graduated from The Hotchkiss School and Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. The fourth child in the family, he was the brother of Prescott ""Pressy"" Bush, Jr. (1922–2010), the 41st President of the United States George H. W. Bush (1924–2018), Nancy Bush Ellis (1926–2021), and William ""Bucky"" Bush (1938–2018). He was the uncle of the 43rd President George W. Bush. Like his brother George H. W. Bush, he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Yale.

Bush and his wife Josephine are the parents of former NBC entertainment reporter Billy Bush and health care executive Jonathan S. Bush.

As of December 31, 2018, Jonathan Bush had retired from Fairfield, Bush & Co., an Investment Advisory Firm in New Haven, Connecticut.

Jonathan Bush founded J. Bush & Co., which provided discreet banking services for the Washington, D.C., embassies of foreign governments for many years. In 1997, Riggs Bank bought J. Bush & Co. and made Bush CEO & President of Riggs Investment, a firm based in New Haven, Connecticut.

In the early 1980s, Jonathan Bush helped organize investors for George W. Bush's first oil venture, Arbusto Energy, later called Bush Explorations.

In 1991, Bush was fined $30,000 in Massachusetts and several thousand dollars in Connecticut for violating registration laws governing securities sales. He was barred from securities brokerage with the general public in Massachusetts for one year.

During the 2000 presidential campaign, Bush was a major contributor and fundraiser to his nephew's election and was named a ""Bush Pioneer"" for raising more than $100,000 for the campaign.

On May 15, 2004, The Washington Post published an article that said, ""A political Web site written by a Democratic operative drew attention yesterday to the fact that President Bush's uncle, Jonathan J. Bush, is a top executive at Riggs Bank, which this week agreed to pay a record $25 million in civil fines for violations of law intended to thwart money laundering.""

The bank accounts under investigation may have been Saudi, though the article did not say so. It did, however, go on to say: ""a source familiar with the multiple federal investigations of the bank's Saudi accounts and other embassy accounts say Jonathan Bush's investment advice unit has 'no relationship whatsoever' with any of the Riggs's Saudi accounts."" Moreover, the newspaper quoted a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as saying ""any suggestion of political influence in the Riggs situation is 'preposterous.'""

Bush died on May 5, 2021, the day before his 90th birthday. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving child of Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush.",1496459-000,False,41,26,,,0.00,2021-05-06 22:03:23.943454+00:00,2021-06-04,2021-05-14 11:45:56.555321+00:00,jonathan-james-bush-112280

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.","1367571-000, DOJ-AP-2018-001032",False,1583,1240,Defiant Defectors and Rebellious Refugees,,0.00,2017-02-14 05:00:00+00:00,2017-04-28,2018-01-23 00:00:00+00:00,kourdakov-33309

The “godly” nation envisioned by the League should be run by an “Anglo-Celtic” (read: white) elite that would establish a Christian theocratic state and politically dominate blacks and other minorities. Originally founded by a group that included many Southern university professors, the group lost its Ph.D.s as it became more explicitly racist. The league denounces the federal government and northern and coastal states as part of “the Empire,” a materialist and anti-religious society. In recent years, it has become increasingly rabid, writing about potential violence, criticizing perceived Jewish power, and warning blacks that they would be defeated in any “race war.” 

Founded in 1994 as the Southern League (it was forced to change its name after a minor baseball league threatened to sue), the overarching mission of the League of the South (LOS) is to accomplish what the Civil War did not — Southern secession. The LOS’ first meeting featured a group of some 40 men, most of them Southern professors. It was and still is led by Michael Hill, who was then a British history professor and specialist in Celtic history at Stillman College, a historically black school in Tuscaloosa, Ala. (Hill has since left his teaching position.)

From the start, the league’s board was dominated by academics. Its unofficial foundational text was Cracker Culture, a book by conservative history professor Grady McWhiney, one of Hill’s mentors, which asserts that the South was populated by immigrants from Celtic areas of England and constitutes a culture and population distinct from that of the North. At the beginning, it only suggested that Southern secession might become necessary if the rest of America did not straighten out.

The LOS grew quickly — “like kudzu,” according to Hill — as white Southerners attracted by the group’s academic veneer and its initial insistence that it was not racist joined up. Within four years of its creation in 1994, the league had recruited 4,000 members. Initially, it seemed to concentrate on a cultural defense of the South, complaining bitterly of the treatment Southerners received in the mainstream media. But it wasn’t long before the group began seriously advocating a second secession, calling for a theocratic form of government, and openly advocating a return to “general European cultural hegemony” in the South.

In the 1990s, the LOS became active in traditional politics. In 1996, it helped orchestrate a successful “Dump Beasley” campaign in South Carolina, where then-Gov. David Beasley, a moderate Republican, supported removing the Confederate battle flag from atop the state Capitol dome. But hints of the group’s future radicalism — the raw anger the league now openly directs at blacks and other minorities — were evident early in its evolution. A year before the campaign against Beasley, Hill had joined a crowd of angry whites, including some professional white supremacists, at the funeral of Michael Westerman, a white man murdered by a black youth, ostensibly for flying the Confederate flag on his pickup truck. At that event, according to Tony Horwitz’s book Confederates in the Attic, Hill declared it was “open season” on anyone who dared to question “the illicit rights bestowed on a compliant and deadly underclass that now fulfills a role similar to that of Hitler’s brown-shirted street thugs of the 1930s.” He was referring to black people.

Along with its academics, the LOS included racist hard-liners from the start. One founding member who still sat on the board of directors in 2007 was Jack Kershaw, a lifelong segregationist who once was an official in the anti-integration White Citizens Councils of the 1950s and 1960s. Kershaw has never hidden his racist views. “Somebody needs to say a good word for slavery,” Kershaw told a reporter in 1998. “Where in the world are the Negroes better off today than in America?”

The LOS, which originally had bragged about the fact that the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) did not then list it as a hate group, quickly became more radical. It came out against interracial marriage. Hill publicly defended antebellum slavery as “God-ordained” and another league leader described segregation as necessary to racial “integrity” of both races, black and white alike. Hill called for a hierarchal society composed of “superiors, equals and inferiors, each protected in their legal privileges” and attacked egalitarianism as a “fatal heresy.” He said people other than white Christians would be allowed to live in his South, but only if they bowed to “the cultural dominance of the Anglo-Celtic people and their institutions.” Where the goal of secession was once largely rhetorical, it became a seriously stated aim.

In 2000, with the group now claiming some 9,000 members (that number would soon grow to 15,000), the SPLC began listing the LOS as a hate group.

In the first years of the new century, the LOS steadily grew more powerful, to the point where for a time it stood at the nexus of the larger neo-Confederate movement. Its ideas about the “Anglo-Celtic” nature of the South were widely accepted by other “pro-South” groups, and it worked with other racist groups like the Council of Conservative Citizens to promote rallies supporting the Confederate battle flag. The LOS took a leadership role in a huge 2000 pro-flag rally in Columbia, S.C., and later the same year also organized a large pro-flag rally in Montgomery, Ala., calling for “Southern Cultural Independence” from the rest of the nation.

Remarkably, the LOS has found a few staunch defenders in the major media, particularly former member Robert Stacy McCain. For years, McCain was a key writer at the ultraconservative — but influential — Washington Times. Even after the Intelligence Report in 2000 exposed McCain’s relationship to the LOS — and the fact that he had published sympathetic essays on the group’s website — Times editors kept him on and even assigned him to cover neo-Confederate events. He resigned years later during a purge of extremist personnel at the newspaper.

Things started falling apart for the LOS in 2001. Within days of the Sept. 11 terrorist strikes in New York City and Washington, D.C., Hill suggested that the attacks were deserved, “the natural fruits of a regime committed to multiculturalism and diversity.” This did not go over well, provoking an exodus of members. Perhaps the most significant blow of all came with the resignation of Donald Livingston as head of the Institute for the Study of Southern Culture and History, the “educational arm” of the LOS, which runs workshops and disseminates books and pamphlets. A professor of philosophy at Emory University, Livingston told the Report that he was put off by the group’s racism and other “political baggage.” 

The LOS’ veneer of professorial respectability has been pierced numerous times, but perhaps never so dramatically as in the case of Michael Tubbs, who in the early 2000s was a leading LOS activist in Florida. In 2004, the Report revealed that Tubbs was actually a convicted “Aryan” terrorist, a man who while in the military had robbed fellow soldiers at gunpoint of their weapons. (During one such theft, he and an accomplice had reportedly shouted, “This is for the KKK!”) When he was arrested, officials found several arms and explosives caches along with lists of targets that included newspapers, television stations and businesses owned by Jews and blacks. When these embarrassing facts were revealed, Hill and other LOS leaders allowed Tubbs to stay on, saying he’d paid his debt to society.

The group’s increasingly hardline positions and recruits have driven many members away. By 2004, many of the group’s original founders — including Hill’s mentors who shepherded him through his history Ph.D. at the University of Alabama, Grady McWhiney and Forrest McDonald — had denounced him. At a 2005 strategy meeting, the LOS struggled to find a handful of interested persons to attend. By 2009, Hill was claiming 25,000 members, but that seemed extremely implausible.

In the fall of 2013, the LOS again shifted its strategy, cloaking its hardline positions in new rhetoric centered on “Southern demographic displacement.” With this new approach, the primary focus of the LOS became small-scale street demonstrations – a  rarely more than 30 people, centered on more mainstream issues such as immigration and “traditional marriage.” This tactical change mirrors the strategy long employed by the Council of Conservative Citizens, an organization that shares a large number of members with LOS. Participants are held to a strict dress code and are not allowed to stray from scripted, LOS-sanctioned messages while demonstrating. The use of the Confederate battle flag was also banned in favor of amore innocuous “Southern nationalist flag,” a black St. Andrews cross over a white background.

Since 2014, the LOS has also led a billboard campaign, erecting signs reading “#SECEDE” on major highways throughout the southeastern United States. The group successfully erected billboards in Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama and Arkansas, and secured up to $10,000.00 in matching donations from an anonymous donor for future billboards.

The LOS reached an unprecedented level of radicalization in the fall of 2014 with the formation of a uniformed, paramilitary unit called the “Indomitables.” The group, which was conceptualized at the 2014 national conference, was the result of years of increasingly violent rhetoric from the group. Its training director, Floyd Eric Meadows, is a veteran of both the U.S. Army and navy with 12 years of service. After a representative of the Southern Poverty Law Center attempted unsuccessfully to contact LOS president Michael Hill, a post appeared on Hill’s personal Facebook stating: “Even if we are – and you really have no idea on earth if we are or not – setting up a Southern militia or some other form of paramilitary organization, we are doing nothing that free men have not done for centuries. Deal with it and stop your whining.”

On April 11, 2015, the LOS hosted an event celebrating the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Organized by the vice chairman of the Maryland-Virginia chapter of the League, Shane Long, the event “commemorate[d] the actions of Mr. John Wilkes Booth of Maryland who, motivated by the tyranny his Southern people faced, answered his calling with courage and fortitude.” The LOS’s main Facebook page put it even more bluntly: “Join us in April to celebrate the great accomplishment of John Wilkes Booth. He knew a man who needed killing when he saw him!”

-----
Leave.EU is an organisation that successfully campaigned for Brexit in the June 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. Founded in July 2015 as The Know, the campaign was relaunched in September with its present name to reflect altered wording in the referendum question.

The following month, the campaign announced it had registered the support of over 270,000 people, including over 1,000 local councillors from all major political parties. In February 2016 the campaign announced that it had over 500,000 supporters.

The campaign, along with rival organisation Vote Leave, aimed to be formally designated as the lead campaign for the Leave vote by the Electoral Commission however, on 13 April 2016, Vote Leave was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official campaign in favour of leaving the European Union for the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016.

In the referendum of June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. By April 2017, the supporters for the Leave.EU campaign had fallen to 88,012

The campaign was co founded by Bristol-based businessman and UKIP donor Arron Banks, with property entrepreneur Richard Tice. It initially set about bringing together a range of different Eurosceptic groups under the umbrella of The Know.
Banks stated a belief that the campaign could not be won from within the Westminster Bubble and that he would build a 'truly cross party campaign for the people and not dominated by politicians.'
As the campaign was being renamed Leave.EU, UKIP leader Nigel Farage gave a public endorsement at the party's annual conference in Doncaster. Farage later clarified that he backed both Leave campaigns as they targeted 'different audiences.'

The campaign was then reportedly refused access to the Conservative annual conference and the TUC annual congress, while being allowed to attend the Labour and Liberal Democrat conferences.[15] American political strategy firm Goddard Gunster was appointed for its expertise in winning referendums.[16] In November 2015, Banks wrote to the Vote Leave group proposing that the two groups should merge. He cited his concern that having two rival Eurosceptic groups was damaging the chances of a campaign victory.

The campaign has petitioned the BBC, ITV and Sky over their alleged conflation of the European Union with the continent of Europe in their output, which it claimed to be an example of media bias.
In March 2016, financial supporter, Peter Hargreaves, wrote to 15 million householders in the United Kingdom asking them to support the leave campaign.

When rival organisation Vote Leave was designated by the Electoral Commission on 13 April 2016 as the official referendum campaign in favour of leaving the EU, Andy Wigmore said that Leave.EU would apply for a judicial review of the decision. He suggested that the referendum could be delayed until 23 October 2016 while the review took place.

However, the next day (14 April 2016), chairman Arron Banks announced that Leave.EU would not be pursuing the judicial review any further. While the campaign states that ""according to legal experts"" it is clear they would win, they have decided that it is time to turn their focus fully towards ""the real opponents in this campaign: those who are repeatedly trying to scare the British public"".

The group remains active, publishing independently of the other campaigns, with Vote Leave focusing on economic benefits in terms of FDI and trade while Leave.EU centring its argument on immigration and how free movement of people across EU and UK has supposedly led to decreased jobs and wages. This has led to situations where Vote Leave and Leave.EU statements have contradicted each other, and sometimes to direct attacks by one pro Brexit group against the other.
After Nigel Farage was not included in a referendum debate, Leave.EU retaliated by publishing the private contact details of BBC officials and Vote Leave members including UKIP MP Douglas Carswell and former UKIP deputy Suzanne Evans.
Referendum spending investigation

On 21 April 2017, the U.K's Electoral Commission announced that it had launched an investigation into the electoral spending of the campaign group at the EU Referendum, saying that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that potential offences may have been committed. The investigation will focus on whether impermissible donations were taken and whether the group's spending return was complete. Arron Banks said the group ""...will be vigorously defending"" the allegations.

He was also a leading figure in UK Zionism.
Sieff was born in Didsbury, Manchester, the second son of Israel Sieff. Starting work for the family company in Hammersmith, London in 1935, Sieff first visited Mandatory Palestine in 1939. He joined the Royal Artillery in the British Army at the outbreak of World War II and received an OBE in 1944 for gallant service. Exiting the British Army with the rank of colonel, he returned to Marks & Spencer, but was asked in 1948 by the first Prime Minister of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, to become an adviser on transportation and supplies to the Israeli Defence ministry. Sieff joined the Israel Defense Forces and helped co-ordinate Marks & Spencer goods and finances to support the new state.

Johnson (August 24, 1945 – July 6, 1992) was an American drag queen, sex worker, and gay liberation activist. A veteran of the Stonewall riots, Johnson was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and was a popular figure in New York City's gay and art scene from the 1960s to the 1990s. Later in life Johnson became an AIDS activist with ACT UP. Marsha P. Johnson was assigned the name Malcolm Michaels Jr. at birth. Attached you will find an obituary as proof of death.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.",1377166-000,False,1470,1293,Freedom of LGBTQIA+ Information,lgbt,0.00,2017-06-07 04:00:00+00:00,2017-07-06,2017-12-01 00:00:00+00:00,marsha-p-johnson-38538

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.",1367521-000,False,1583,1357,Scientology is Fair Game,,0.00,2017-02-14 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-15,2017-09-28 00:00:00+00:00,mary-lee-south-33298

This material was left at a ""dead drop"" site code-named ""DORIS""  in Canterbury Park in Fairfax County, Virginia. In exchange for this information, Hanssen was paid $30,000.00 USD by the Soviet

ramirezalej,Pam the Funkstress record,No Responsive Documents,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/pam-the-funkstress-record-53813/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"To Whom It May Concern:

This letter constitutes a request under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (collectively, “FOIA/PA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 552, 552a, and the Department of Justice’s (“DOJ”) implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 16, by independent journalist Alejandro Ramirez. For purposes of this request, the definition of “records” includes, but is not limited to, documents, letters, faxes, memoranda, notes, reports, e-mail messages (including e-mails to and from personal e-mail accounts), other correspondence, orders, policy statements, data, technical evaluations or analysis, and studies. The definition of “records” expressly refers to materials already in existence, whether in physical or electronic form, and does not imply any need for DOJ to create new records.

A. Request for disclosure

I seek disclosure of any and all records or communications created from Jan. 8, 1947, to the date your office processes this request, inclusive, that were prepared, received, transmitted, collected, and/or maintained by the FBI relating or referring to Pam Warren, better known by her stage name Pam the Funkstress. 

I request these records pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 16.3(a)(4) (""Where a request for records pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by ... submitting proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary)""). Ms. Warren died on Dec 22, 2017, as reported Rolling Stone and other media outlets (https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/pam-the-funkstress-the-coup-dj-dead-at-51-w514656).

Associated acts of Ms. Warren include Prince (Prince Rogers Nelson), The Coup, and Boots Riley (Raymond Lawrence Riley).

B. Search parameters

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.

C. Request for limitation of processing fees

I request a limitation of processing fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) (“fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by ... a representative of the news media”) and 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.11(c)(1)(i) and 16.11(d)(1) (“Search fees shall be charged for all requests — other than requests made by … representatives of the news media,” and “No search fee will be charged for requests by … representatives of the news media”). As a “representative of the news media,” I fit within this statutory and regulatory exemption. Fees associated with the processing of this request should, therefore, be limited accordingly.

I meet the definition of a “representative of the news media” because I am “an entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience.” See National Security Archive v. Department of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1387 (D.C. Cir. 1989).

I am a full-time, professional journalist who has reported on rap music, Latino issues, immigration, homelessness and politics. My reporting on these topics has appeared in VICE, the Boston Globe, Boston Institute for Nonprofit Journalism, Scout Somerville, Scout Cambridge, Dig Boston, and WBUR. In addition, I am the current editor-in-chief of Spare Change News, both located in Boston, Mass. My portfolio is available at ramirezalej.contently.com.

Although I am a freelance journalist, my ongoing professional relationship with editors at a number of outlets ensures any articles I write based on these documents will be published, demonstrating “a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization,” as required by the definition of “representative of the news media” in C.F.R. § 16.11 (b)(6). Under that same regulation, “components shall also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.” Id.

This request is made as part of the news-gathering process and not for commercial purposes. As such, I am entitled to a limitation of processing fees.

In the event that processing fees cannot be limited, please inform me of the anticipated total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

D. Request for fee waiver

I additionally request a waiver of all costs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) (“Documents shall be furnished without any charge ... if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester”) and C.F.R. § 16.11(k)(1) (“Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below that established … where a component determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that … Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and … Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester”). This request is made as part of the news-gathering process and not for commercial purposes. As such, I am entitled to a fee waiver.

Disclosure in this case meets the statutory criteria, and a fee waiver would fulfill Congress’s legislative intent in amending FOIA. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“Congress amended FOIA to ensure that it be ‘liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters.’”).

Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. This request will further public understanding of government conduct; specifically, the FBI’s monitoring, surveillance, and infiltration of organizations on the basis of organizational membership, political views or affiliation, or participation in protest activities or demonstrations. This type of government activity concretely affects many individuals and groups and implicates basic privacy, free speech, and associational rights protected by the Constitution.

Moreover, disclosure of the requested information will aid public understanding of the implications of the Department of Justice’s decision to relax guidelines that previously restricted the FBI’s ability to spy on organizations without a threshold showing of suspected criminal activity. These restrictions were created in response to the Hoover-era FBI’s surveillance of politically active individuals and organizations, despite the lack of evidence that such individuals and organizations had been involved in any unlawful behavior. Understanding the scope of the FBI’s surveillance and infiltration of law-abiding organizations is, therefore, crucial to the public’s interest in understanding the consequences of the Department of Justice’s important change in policy.

As a “representative of the news media,” supra Section C, I am well-situated to disseminate the information I gain from this request to the general public, to targeted communities, and to groups that protect constitutional rights. Because I meet the test for a fee waiver, fees associated with responding to my FOIA/PA requests should be – and regularly are – waived.

The records requested are not sought for commercial use. I plan to disseminate the information disclosed as a result of this FOIA/PA request through the channels

In the event that fees cannot be waived, please inform me of the anticipated total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

E. Miscellany

Pursuant to applicable regulations and statute, I expect the determination of this request for documents within 20 days of your receipt of this request. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i) and 28 C.F.R. § 16.5(d)(4).

If this request is denied, in whole or in part, please justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions to FOIA/PA. DOJ must also release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. I reserve the right to appeal any decision to withhold any information in whole or in part, to deny the request to limit processing fees, or to deny the request for a fee waiver.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,
Alejandro Ramirez",1406030-000,False,1131,1102,,,0.00,2018-05-12 22:10:07.428995+00:00,2018-06-11,2018-05-23 13:54:35.565145+00:00,pam-the-funkstress-record-53813

Smith (Feb 23, 1936 – May 14, 2017). His death has been widely reported. http://www.rtfunerals.com/obituaries/Peter-Smith-7/#!/Obituary

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.

On June 29, the Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Smith had sought Hillary Clinton's hacked emails during the 2016 presidential election, identifying five groups that claimed to have the data, including two suspected of being Russians. The article is located at https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-operative-sought-clinton-emails-from-hackers-implied-a-connection-to-flynn-1498770851?mg=prod/accounts-wsj. A summary that does not require sign-in is located at http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-gop-operative-looked-to-get-clinton-emails-from-hacker-said-he-worked-with-flynn/
 
I respectfully request that you waive all fees in connection with this request as provided by 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). The Sierra Club is a national environmental nonprofit with no commercial interest in obtaining the requested information. Instead, our organization intends to analyze and disseminate the requested information free of charge so that the public can be better informed and meaningfully participate in the safeguarding of our nation's democratic institutions and voting systems.
 
FBI records relating to Mr. Smith may shed a light on a matter of public interest: attempts by individuals affiliated with the Russian government to interfere with U.S. elections. The subject matter of the requested records is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government by disclosing what intelligence agencies knew about the attempted hacking of former Secretary Clinton's emails, and what they did in response. Multiple intelligence officials and members of Congress have stated that they expect Russian-backed hackers' attacks on sensitive U.S. systems to increase.
 
The Sierra Club and its supporters have demonstrated interest and expertise in the subject area, specifically the promotion of policies designed to expand voting. We maintain an active Democracy program and weigh in on legislation, presidential nominations, and administrative proposals that affect our issues.
 
In addition, I ask to be properly categorized as a representative of the news media. The bulk of my professional duties at the Sierra Club entails planning and writing content about public policy, including composing mass communications to our followers, analyzing FOIA responses, and coordinating with press secretaries. Here are some examples that resulted from my work:
 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/05/19/nearly-700-vacancies-at-cdc-because-of-trump-administration-hiring-freeze/

http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/press-releases/4480/over-700000-people-tell-government-to-block-seed-mergers 
 
The Sierra Club has the ability and intention to disseminate the information it receives through this request. The information may be shared through emails to an audience reaching into the millions, Facebook and Twitter posts reaching tens of thousands of followers, articles on our often-visited website, and analysis provided to the media.
 
Due to the exceptional circumstances surrounding Russian hacking, I request expedited treatment of this FOIA request, which meets several of the Department of Justice’s rationales:
 
1. The request concerns a matter of current exigency to the American public, given that U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the upcoming G-20 Summit. If any collusion was found to have taken place between Mr. Smith, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, and Russian hackers, that should be made known to the public and hopefully addressed between President Trump and President Putin directly, so as to prevent future acts of electoral interference between non-state actors (the Trump campaign and Mr. Smith have denied that Mr. Smith was working on the campaign's behalf).
2. The consequences of delaying a response would compromise a significant recognized interest. Delaying this information through the normal FOIA process would represent a clear loss in value to the developing breaking news stories around Mr. Smith's contacts with hackers as well as Mr. Flynn's contacts with Russian officials.
3. The request concerns federal government activity, specifically the FBI's monitoring of individuals believed to be attempting to illegally access sensitive data of a U.S. citizen, former secretary of State, and at the time, presidential candidate.",1379337-000,False,1447,1342,,,0.00,2017-06-30 04:00:00+00:00,2017-07-31,2017-10-13 00:00:00+00:00,peter-w-smith-39375

The PHIRM broke up in 1990, voluntarily, stating that after the Legion of Doom arrests that they had become too high-profile. In 1985 a Phrack magazine article brought the group into the public eye, and they began to take on new members. In 1987 two of the founders, Archangel and Stingray, co-authored a report on Cleveland's Freenet. In 1989 the group published a definitive guide to breaking security on Bank of America home banking systems. This brought a great deal of scrutiny on the group and there were arrests. At the time of the break-up of the PHIRM, however, there were still over 100 members.","1422715-000, DOJ-AP-2019-002809",False,941,748,Hacking History,,0.00,2018-11-18 02:58:15.428778+00:00,2018-12-17,2019-05-30 18:40:48.106211+00:00,phirm-63896

EmmaBest,Pioneer Fund,No Responsive Documents,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/pioneer-fund-31271/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning the Pioneer Fund. Started in 1937 by textile magnate Wickliffe Draper, the Pioneer Fund's original mandate was to pursue ""race betterment"" by promoting the genetic stock of those ""deemed to be descended predominantly from white persons who settled in the original thirteen states prior to the adoption of the Constitution.""

The Pioneer Fund's original endowment came from Wickliffe Draper, scion of old-stock Protestant gentry. Living in what one historian described as a ""quasi-feudal manor house,"" Draper was raised in Hopedale, Mass., a company town built by his family. After losing a four-month union battle with the far-left International Workers of the World, Draper became a man obsessively seeking a way to restore the old order. Abandoned by the political mainstream after World War II, Draper turned more and more to those academics who were still dedicated to race science and eugenics — most prominently, in the early years, Henry Garrett. During the 1950s and 1960s, Garrett helped distribute Pioneer grants and was one of the founders of the International Association for the Advancement of Eugenics and Ethnology (IAAEE) in 1959. The IAAEE brought together academic defenders of segregation in the United States and apartheid in South Africa. The Pioneer Fund also supported a variety of institutions working to legitimize race ""science,"" including the IAAEE and the journal Mankind Quarterly, which today is published by long-time eugenicist, anti-Semite and Pioneer grant recipient Roger Pearson.

Many of those involved with the fund early on, including its first president Harry H. Laughlin, had ""contacts with many of the Nazi scientists whose work provided the conceptual template for Hitler's aspiration toward ‘racial hygiene' in Germany,"" according to an article in the Albany Law Review. In the 1960s, according to William Tucker's scholarly book, The Funding of Scientific Racism, many board members and recipients of Pioneer grants worked to block the civil rights movement. 

Arthur Jensen, an educational psychologist focusing on race since 1966, got more than $1 million in Pioneer grants over three decades. In his famous 1969 attack on Head Start — the early-education program that aims to help poor children — Jensen wrote in the prestigious Harvard Education Review that the problem with black children was that they had an average IQ of only 85. No amount of social engineering could improve that performance, he claimed, adding that ""eugenic foresight"" was the only solution.

Roger Pearson, whose Institute for the Study of Man has been one of the top Pioneer Fund beneficiaries over the past 20 years, may provide the clearest indication of the kind of extremists supported by the fund. Pearson came to the United States in the mid-1960s to join Willis Carto, founder of the anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby. In 1965, Pearson became editor of Western Destiny, a magazine established by Carto and dedicated to spreading extreme-right ideology. Using the pseudonym Stephan Langton, he then became editor of The New Patriot, a short-lived magazine published in 1966 and 1967 to conduct ""a responsible but penetrating inquiry into every aspect of the Jewish Question."" Its articles carried such titles as ""Zionists and the Plot Against South Africa,"" ""Early Jews and the Rise of Jewish Money Power"" and ""Swindlers of the Crematoria."" Pioneer support for all the groups linked to Pearson between 1975 and 1996 amounted to more than $1 million — nearly 10% of total Pioneer grants during that period. 

In recent decades, the Pioneer Fund has supported mostly American and British race scientists, including a large number of those cited in The Bell Curve, a widely criticized 1994 book that claimed that differences in intelligence were at least partly determined by race. According to Barry Mehler, a leading academic critic of the fund, these race scientists have included Hans Eysenck, Robert A. Gordon, Linda Gottfredson, Seymour Itzkoff, Arthur Jensen, Michael Levin, Richard Lynn, R. Travis Osborne, J. Philippe Rushton, William Shockley and Daniel R. Vining Jr.

Since 2002, the Pioneer Fund has been headed by Rushton, a Canadian professor who has been investigated for allegedly violating Canadian hate-speech laws. Rushton first courted controversy in 1989 when he published work focusing on the sexual characteristics of different races. His findings: blacks have larger genitals, breasts and buttocks — characteristics that Rushton alleges have an inverse relationship to brain size and, thus, intelligence. Rushton has personally received over $1 million in Pioneer funds to support his work.

While Rushton has been ridiculed and attacked as a racist by many leading scholars — including Stanford population biologist Mark Feldman, who described one of his main books as ""laughable"" — he has been sometimes been cited as a legitimate expert by the mainstream media. In 2006, for example, CNN's medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, put Rushton on the air to discuss a Rushton study that supposedly proved that males, on average, are smarter than women. Two years later, Rushton was interviewed for National Public Radio's ""News & Notes"" on the topic ""Race and Intelligence: Is There a Link?"" In both cases, no mention was made of Rushton's background or that of the Pioneer Fund.

Under Rushton's leadership, the Pioneer Fund has continued to support extremists. According to Hold Your Tongue, a 1993 book by education expert James Crawford, the Pioneer Fund has ""aided the Institute for Western Values — the same group [the late] Cordelia Scaife May [sister of far-right financier Richard Mellon Scaife] paid to distribute [the racist nativist book] The Camp of the Saints — and in publishing the autobiography of Thomas Dixon,"" whose white supremacist novels helped spark the Klan's 1915 rebirth. Recent Pioneer grantees have included white supremacist Jared Taylor and Pioneer Fund board members Rushton and Richard Lynn, who runs the one-man Ulster Institute for Social Research and has argued that blacks have a ""psychopathic"" personality. Pioneer also has given grants to anti-immigrant groups, including the American Immigration Control Foundation (AICF), the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), and Project USA, an anti-immigration group run by a one-time FAIR board member. Both AICF and FAIR are listed as racist hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Some organizations have refused grants from the fund in the wake of continuing bad publicity. One recipient, Hiroko Arikawa of the Forest Institute of Professional Psychology in Springfield, Mo., said she was returning her grant after being contacted for comment in 2006 by the Intelligence Report. 

In recent years, the fund has mostly been giving grants to its own board members and a few other groups that are not embarrassed to be the beneficiaries of its racist charity. For example, from 2002 to 2006, board member Richard Lynn's Ulster Institute for Social Research received $286,372. During the same period, Rushton, the fund's president, received, through the University of Western Ontario where he teaches, $301,326. The other big beneficiary of Pioneer handouts is American Renaissance, a racist newsletter published by Rushton's close friend, Jared Taylor, who recently argued in its pages that blacks are incapable of sustaining any kind of civilization. Taylor's journal focuses on eugenics and alleged race-based differences in intelligence. 

Pioneer does have one remaining major donor, Walter P. Kistler, who is in the Aviation Hall of Fame and founder of Kistler Aerospace. In 1996, Kistler also endowed in perpetuity the well-known Bellevue, Wash., science outfit, Foundation for the Future.

He was a professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College and a faculty member of the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research. Isay is considered a pioneer who changed the way that psychoanalysts view homosexuality. 

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.",1396377-000,False,1467,1203,Freedom of LGBTQIA+ Information,lgbt,0.00,2017-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,2017-07-10,2018-03-01 00:00:00+00:00,richard-isay-38642

Ronald Lee Ridenhour (April 6, 1946 – May 10, 1998), as a young GI who served in the 11th Infantry Brigade during the Vietnam War, played a central role in spurring the investigation of the My Lai Massacre.[1] 

A helicopter gunner, Ridenhour heard of the massacre from friends while serving in Vietnam. While still on active duty, he gathered eyewitness and participant accounts from other soldiers. On his return to the United States, he sent letters to 30 members of Congress and to Pentagon officials, spurring a probe that led to several indictments against those involved, and the conviction of William Calley. His own account of learning about the massacre can be found in the article, ""Jesus Was a Gook,"" published in Nobody Gets Off the Bus: The Viet Nam Generation Big Book.

Ridenhour, a 1972 graduate of Claremont Men's College, went on to become an investigative journalist, winning a George Polk Award in 1987 for his expose of a tax scandal in New Orleans, based on a year-long investigation.

He died of a heart attack in 1998, aged 52, in Metairie, Louisiana.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.",1377544-000,False,1467,1294,Freedom of LGBTQIA+ Information,,0.00,2017-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,2017-07-10,2017-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,ruth-simpson-38650

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.","1367504-000, DOJ-AP-2018-002252",False,1583,951,,,0.00,2017-02-14 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-15,2017-10-23 00:00:00+00:00,saint-valentines-day-massacre-33302

Note that his first name has also been spelled Said, Syed, Seyyid, Sayid, or Sayed; and his last name Koteb, Qutub, Kotb, or Kutb.

Qutb was raised in Musha, Asyut Province, Egypt and worked as a teacher in Cairo. In 1948, he received a scholarship to study at Colorado State College for Education in Greeley, Colorado. Over the next two years, Qutb also worked and studied Wilson Teachers' College in Washington, D.C. (one of the precursors to today's University of the District of Columbia) and Stanford University. During this time, he published Al-'adala al-Ijtima'iyya fi-l-Islam (Social Justice in Islam) in 1949.

Qutb's experiences in America left him disillusioned with Western values. Upon his return to Egypt, he joined the Muslim Brotherhood and wrote a scathing critique of American society titled Amrika allati Ra'aytu (The America that I Have Seen). Qutb rose through the ranks of the Muslim Brotherhood to become editor-in-chief of the organization's weekly Al-Ikhwan al-Muslimin, and later head of propaganda for the entire organization.

Egyptian authorities arrested Qutb in 1954 after the Muslim Brotherhood attempted to assassinate President Gamal Abdel Nasser. He was released in late 1964, re-arrested in August 1965, sentenced to death, and executed in August 1966. Qutb was tortured in prison. He also wrote a commentary of the Qur'an called Fi Zilal al-Qur'an (In the Shade of the Qur'an), and a manifesto of political Islam called Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq (Milestones) during his imprisonment.

Qutb's philosophy later inspired several militant Islamist leaders, including Ruhollah Khomeini, Ayman Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden, and Anwar al-Awlaki. The Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (""The 9/11 Commission Report"") cites Qutb as a major influence on bin Laden's worldview, leading to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

Magnitsky had alleged there had been a large-scale theft from the Russian state, sanctioned and carried out by Russian officials. He was arrested and eventually died in prison seven days before the expiration of the one-year term during which he could be legally held without trial. In total, Magnitsky served 358 days in Moscow's Butyrka prison. 

He developed gallstones, pancreatitis and a blocked gall bladder and received inadequate medical care. A human rights council set up by the Kremlin found that he was physically assaulted shortly before his death. 

His case has become an international cause célèbre and led to the adoption of the Magnitsky bill by the U.S. government at the end of 2012 by which those Russian officials believed to be involved in the auditor’s death were barred from entering the United States or using its banking system. In response, Russia blocked hundreds of foreign adoptions.In early January 2013, the Financial Times wrote that ""the Magnitsky case is egregious, well documented and encapsulates the darker side of Putinism"" and endorsed the idea of imposing similar sanctions against the implicated Russian officials by the EU countries.

In 2012, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a Sarajevo-based network of investigative centers, successfully traced some of the missing funds to a company owned by Denis Katsyv, the son of Pyotr Katsyv, the wealthy and powerful former minister of transportation in the Moscow region. The money had gone into a real estate firm that was buying luxury Wall Street apartments. The US Department of Justice filed a seizure order to recover the apartments in Sept. 2013.
In 2013, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit news organization, obtained records of companies and trusts created by two offshore companies which included information on at least 23 companies linked to an alleged $230 million tax fraud in Russia, a case that was being investigated by Sergei Magnitsky. The ICIJ investigation also revealed that the husband of one of the Russian tax officials deposited millions in a Swiss bank account set up by one of the offshore companies.",1382358-000,False,1407,1399,,,0.00,2017-08-09 04:00:00+00:00,2017-09-07,2017-08-17 00:00:00+00:00,sergei-magnitsky-41693

If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

Society founder Henry Gerber was inspired to create it by German Doctor Magnus Hirschfeld and his work with the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee. It was the first recognized gay rights organization in the United States, having received a charter from the state of Illinois, and produced the first American publication for homosexuals, Friendship and Freedom.. As the group is not a person, no proof of death is required and there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. 

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.",1377203-000,False,1470,1294,Freedom of LGBTQIA+ Information,,0.00,2017-06-07 04:00:00+00:00,2017-07-06,2017-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,society-for-human-rights-38544

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

Founded in 2001 by Chicago millionaire publishing scion William H. Regnery, the Charles Martel Society publishes The Occidental Quarterly (TOQ), a racist journal devoted to the idea that as whites become a minority ""the civilization and free governments that whites have created"" will be jeopardized. 

William H. Regnery II, an heir to the Regnery publishing fortune, made his mark as a major player in radical-right circles when he founded the Charles Martel Society in 2001 as a nonprofit group. The organization is named in honor of Charles Martel, who is credited with saving Europe by defeating an invading Muslim force at the Battle of Tours in 734. In keeping with the actions of its namesake, the Charles Martel Society seeks to protect what it sees as the white European heritage of America from a perceived ethnic and ideological invasion by non-Europeans. To this end, the group is strongly against immigration (except from industrialized European nations) and dedicated to the idea that ""race informs culture."" 

The society is best known for publishing The Occidental Quarterly (TOQ), a journal that ""unapologetically defends the cultural, ethnic, and racial interests of Western European peoples and examines contemporary political, social, and demographic trends that impact the posterity of Western Civilization."" To help run TOQ, Regnery assembled some of the biggest names from radical right circles. Its one-time chief editor was Kevin Lamb, who had written for racist publications since the 1990s, when he published articles in Mankind Quarterly, a eugenics journal. TOQ's former managing editor was Louis Andrews, whose Washington Summit Publishers reprints a range of classical and modern racist tracts, along with books on eugenics. Its associate editor was Wayne Lutton, who also works at the Social Contract Press, also a hate group (according to the society's 2006 tax forms, Lutton is on its board of directors). TOQ's editorial advisory board has contained such notables as Richard Lynn, who called for ""phasing out"" people from ""incompetent cultures""; American Renaissance Editor Jared Taylor, who also serves as a board member and whose book, The Color of Crime, sought to ""prove"" that blacks are far more criminal than whites; and Virginia Abernethy, a retired professor who has close ties to the racist Council of Conservative Citizens who has described herself as a white separatist.

TOQ also publishes an array of other extremists, including Robert S. Griffin, a University of Vermont professor who has been a member of the neo-Nazi National Alliance and promoter of its late leader, and the well-known racist writer Marian Kester Coombs, wife of Fran Coombs, the longtime managing editor of The Washington Times who was forced out of his job in 2007.

In 2004, the society went beyond publishing for the first time, holding a black-tie dinner in a fancy Washington, D.C., hotel, where it awarded California State University, Long Beach, Psychology Professor and major anti-Semite Kevin MacDonald $10,000 and its Jack London Literary Prize for books describing the alleged ""group evolutionary strategies"" of the Jews. MacDonald is a favorite of TOQ, having written several articles for the journal on the tactics Jews supposedly engage in, such as supporting high levels of non-white immigration in order to reduce the power of whites in America. The society has a held a handful of other small gatherings of its supporters, according to its tax forms. Since that time, the group has held several private meetings featuring various prominent academic racists.

The Charles Martel Society and its journal have been very well received among academic racists in America — so much so that when Florida race scientist and professor Glayde Whitney (Whitney had written an adoring introduction to neo-Nazi David Duke's anti-Semitic autobiography) died in 2002, his family asked that in lieu of flowers, mourners send donations to the society. 

According to the society's 2005 tax returns, Regnery stepped down from his role at the society that year. Since then, the society, which also includes The Occidental Press (an outfit that publishes and sells racist books, in addition to The Occidental Quarterly), has as its president of the board former Klan lawyer and Holocaust denier Sam Dickson, whose is a property lawyer from Atlanta. Dickson has built a multimillion-dollar business in the niche field of tax liens and title acquisition, concentrating on acquiring distressed properties inexpensively from poor, black clients in Georgia.

The society's 2006 tax return showed that other board members included MacDonald; white nationalist Wayne Lutton, who edits the anti-immigrant hate journal The Social Contract, Jared Taylor, editor of the racist newsletter American Renaissance, and Kevin Lamb, who was fired from his managing editor position at Human Events in 2005, after his racist pieces for publications like TOQ were disclosed to his employers by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Lamb left TOQ in 2007, however, as a result of what he calls an ""editorial purge."" He later joined the Social Contract Press as its managing editor.

The press is a program of U.S. Inc, the foundation created by John Tanton, the racist founder and principal ideologue of the modern nativist movement. TSCP puts an academic veneer of legitimacy over what are essentially racist arguments about the inferiority of today's immigrants.

The Social Contract Press (TSCP) was founded in 1990 by John Tanton, a man who has set up and funded several anti-immigration groups over the past 30 years. TSCP is the publishing wing of Tanton's network of organizations. In addition to putting out books, many of them extremely anti-immigrant, TSCP prints a quarterly journal, The Social Contract, which has featured articles by dozens of white nationalists and anti-immigrant extremists.

From 1990 to 1998, John Tanton served as editor of The Social Contract. In the 1980s, Tanton wrote often to colleagues about the movement's need for a reputable journal to synthesize ideas; the TSCP's The Social Contract became that journal. Tanton is deeply connected to white nationalist groups and leaders. He has corresponded with Holocaust deniers, a former Klan lawyer and the leading white nationalist thinkers of the modern era. Tanton is also the founder of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), the nation's most influential anti-immigrant lobbying organization, which was listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2007. No longer editor of The Social Contract, Tanton serves as publisher of the entire press operation.

In 1994, TSCP republished an English translation of the an openly racist French book that is also Tanton's favorite tome, The Camp of the Saints, with Tanton writing that he was ""honored"" to republish the novel. What Tanton called a ""prescient"" book describes the takeover of France by ""swarthy hordes"" of Indians, ""grotesque little beggars from the streets of Calcutta,"" who arrive in a desperate refugee flotilla. It attacks white liberals who, rather than turn the Indians away, ""empty out all our hospital beds so that cholera-ridden and leprous wretches could sprawl between white sheets … and cram our nurseries full of monster children."" In the novel, after the Indians take over France, white women are sent to a ""whorehouse for Hindus."" Dark-skinned immigrants eventually overrun the entire white Western world. Reflecting on the novel, Tanton wrote in the winter 1994-1995 issue of The Social Contract: ""We are indebted to Jean Raspail [author of The Camp of the Saints] for his insights into the human condition, and for being 20 years ahead of his time. History will judge him more kindly than have some of his contemporaries.""

TSCP publishes huge quantities of fear-mongering articles and books. Besides the reprint of The Camp of the Saints, perhaps its most inflammatory publication is The Immigration Invasion. Put out in 1994, the book was co-written by Tanton and white nationalist Wayne Lutton, The Social Contract's current editor. It is so incendiary that Canadian border authorities have banned it as hate literature.

Lutton, a longtime contributor to The Social Contract, became the editor of the journal in 1998. Lutton has an extensive extremist track record. He has held leadership positions in four other white nationalist hate groups: the Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC), the National Policy Institute, The Occidental Quarterly and American Renaissance. In the early 1980s, Lutton worked at far-right Summit Ministries in Manitou, Colo. While there, Lutton co-authored AIDS, a gay-bashing book, with Summit president David Noebel and Paul Cameron, who runs the anti-gay hate group Family Research Institute and is widely known for perpetrating academically faulty ""junk-science"" studies on homosexuality. Published in 1987, the nonfiction work proposed to ""suppress"" homosexuality by making gay sex illegal, prohibiting gays from having custody of children, including their own, ""quarantining"" HIV-positive gays who engage in sex and denying all AIDS patients admittance to regular hospitals.

Lutton has strongly expressed his belief that the United States is a country of white people, for white people. ""We are the real Americans, not the Hmong, not Latinos, not the Siberian-Americans,"" Lutton declared in 1997 at a conference put on by the white supremacist CCC. ""As far as the future, the handwriting is on the screen. The Camp of the Saints is coming our way.""

In 2006, Tanton brought Kevin Lamb on as managing editor of The Social Contract. The prior year, Lamb was fired from two mainstream managing editor positions with Human Events and The Evans-Novak Political Report after the Southern Poverty Law Center revealed that Lamb was concurrently editing The Occidental Quarterly, a white nationalist journal. After his firing, Lamb wrote a bitter essay saying that several fellow employees had known of his work for the racist quarterly, including Al Regnery, the conservative publisher who owns Human Events. In fact, Lamb had written for racist publications as far back as the early 1990s, when he published works in Mankind Quarterly. He also edited a 2002 book on Glayde Whitney, a racist academic who once wrote a fawning introduction for former Klan leader David Duke's autobiography My Awakening.

The Social Contract has published articles by many white nationalists including Samuel Francis, who was the CCC'S chief editor until his death in 2005, and James Lubinskas, at one time a contributing editor for the racist American Renaissance magazine. Other contributors include Michael Masters, the leader of the Virginia chapter of the CCC and Brenda Walker, a frequent writer on the VDARE anti-immigrant hate site and a major propagator of the Aztlán conspiracy theory that holds that immigrants come to the United States not to work, but to colonize.

In 1998, The Social Contract released a particularly racist special issue entitled ""Europhobia: The Hostility Toward European-Descended Americans."" The lead article was written by John Vinson, head of the Tanton-supported hate group American Immigration Control Foundation, and argued that ""multiculturalism"" was replacing ""successful Euro-American culture"" with ""dysfunctional Third World cultures."" Tanton himself elaborated on Vinson's remarks, saying an ""unwarranted hatred and fear"" of white Americans was developing. The main culprits, in Tanton's view, were immigrants and their ideological allies, the ""multiculturalists.""

The winter 2006-2007 issue of The Social Contract consisted entirely of reprints of articles from the hate site VDARE.com, which features racist and anti-Semitic articles. VDARE is named after Virginia Dare, said to be the first English baby born in the United States. Its contributors include Peter Brimelow, professor Kevin MacDonald, who believes that Jews are genetically driven to destroy Western societies, and Jared Taylor, editor of the racist newsletter American Renaissance.

The Fall 2010 issue of The Social Contract, titled ""The Menace of Islam,"" pushed the bounds of the journal's already rancorous prose. In it, one author refers to Park51, a Muslim community center with a construction site two blocks away from the World Trade Center site, as a ""victory mosque."" The article claims that the building of the center is the first step in a conspiracy to enact Islamic law in the United States. Another article refers to the ""greed"" of Muslim immigrants to the United States and describes them as an ""alien force"" that has ""infested"" the country. In the issue, K.C. McAlpin – who last year was promoted to president of U.S. Inc., replacing Tanton, who is suffering from Parkinson's – warns that Muslim immigrants should be seen as a ""Trojan horse,"" a group of people who are stealthily attempting to infiltrate and destroy the United States. McAlpin argues that all Muslim immigration to the United States must be stopped.

He served as Bishop of Phoenix from 1982 to 2003. 

In 2002, Maricopa County prosecutors initiated a grand jury investigation into charges of sexual abuse by Catholic priests in the diocese of Phoenix. Bishop O'Brien was a target of that investigation for allegedly covering-up allegations against other priests. The prosecution ended when the bishop admitted he had sheltered abusive priests. O'Brien agreed to cede his authority over diocesan sexual abuse policy in exchange for immunity from indictment for obstruction of justice. On August 4, 2017, it was announced that a civil lawsuit was filed against O'Brien over allegations that he sexually molested a boy on several occasions at parishes in Phoenix and Goodyear from 1977 to 1982.

On June 14, 2003, less than two weeks after signing the sexual abuse agreement with prosecutors, O'Brien struck and killed 43-year-old Jim Reed in a hit-and-run car accident. A driver behind O'Brien reported O'Brien's license plate number to the police. Police also discovered a dent in a fender and a crack in the windshield of the bishop's Buick Park Avenue. O'Brien later claimed he did not report the accident because he thought he had hit a dog, cat, or rock. O'Brien was arrested for leaving the scene of an accident and released on $45,000 bond. He resigned as Bishop on June 18, 2003.

On February 17, 2004, O'Brien was found guilty of leaving the scene of a fatal accident after a three-and-a-half-week-long trial. On March 26, 2004, he was sentenced to four years' probation and 1,000 hours of community service, and required to surrender his driver's license for five years.

EmmaBest,Traditional Values Coalition,No Responsive Documents,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/traditional-values-coalition-31274/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning Traditional Values Coalition. Presbyterian minister Lou Sheldon founded the Traditional Values Coalition (TVC) in 1980 to spread a “moral code and behavior based upon the Old and New Testaments” and to warn Americans of the rising “gay threat.” The traditional values the TVC fights for include: the right to life (opposition to abortion and euthanasia), chastity and patriotism, along with opposition to homosexuality, pornography, the teaching of evolution in public schools and illegal immigration.

Louis P. Sheldon founded the Traditional Values Coalition in Anaheim to focus on California politics. It was initially named the American Liberties Institute and later, the California Coalition for Traditional Values, before establishing its headquarters in Washington, D.C. Sheldon is a protégé of Christian Right televangelist Pat Robertson and already was a long-standing opponent of gay rights when he founded the TVC in 1980. Sheldon claims that homosexuality is a “deathstyle” and that child molestation is the real “homosexual agenda” — a claim that has been thoroughly debunked by all the relevant major professional and medical associations.

In 1985, Sheldon suggested forcibly rounding up AIDS victims into “cities of refuge,” like leper colonies, to protect the general population. After a hate crime bill was signed into law in the 1990s, Sheldon told a reporter that the new law would “protect sex with animals and the rape of children as forms of political expression,” which was completely false. The law did no such thing and could not legally.

In 1992, columnist Jimmy Breslin reported that Sheldon told him that “homosexuals are dangerous. They proselytize. They come to the door, and if your son answers and nobody is there to stop it, they grab the son and run off with him. They steal him. They take him away and turn him into a homosexual.” Sheldon later denied making those comments, but his website contains strikingly similar language: “[S]ince homosexuals can’t reproduce, they will simply go after your children for seduction and conversion to homosexuality.” Elsewhere, it claims that “[t]he effort to push adult/child sex … is part of the overall homosexual movement.”

Three years later, in 1995, Sheldon successfully lobbied for a congressional hearing on gay activists’ alleged infiltration of public schools in an attempt to garner support for Senator Jesse Helms’ bill to cut federal funds for public schools “encouraging or supporting homosexuality.” The hearing, however, was a disaster for Sheldon and his supporters. The hearing’s main witness was Claire Connolly, a lesbian who falsely accused gay male activists of using federal AIDS funds to host orgies.

Like her father, Andrea Lafferty, now TVC’s president, has also made a number of LGBT-bashing remarks over the years. In February 2013, Lafferty compared homosexuality to drunk driving after U.S. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) changed his views on gay marriage when his son came out as gay. After the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in June of that year, Lafferty lamented that a “great darkness” had overtaken the country. When the House of Representatives held a historic hearing on transgender discrimination in the workplace in 2008, Lafferty called it a “freak show,” and insisted transgendered individuals were “deeply disturbed individuals who need therapy not coddling and affirmation by a liberal majority in the House of Representatives.”

After Congress introduced the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in 2013, the TVC released a slew of anti-transgender press releases attacking ENDA with allegations that the bill would force every school district to hire transgender teachers and bring “gender confusion” into schools. One such press release likened school-aged children to “human shields” who were being used in the attempt to “force the acceptance of transgenders and transsexuals into mainstream culture.” After California Gov. Jerry Brown signed the School Success and Opportunity Act, a bill that allows students to participate in activities, sports teams, programs, and locker room and restroom facilities that match their gender identities, the TVC released a memo labeling transgender children “psychologically unhealthy.”

In spite of their homophobic and very often flatly false remarks and claims, Sheldon and Lafferty have enjoyed considerable political access.  During the George W. Bush administration, Sheldon and Lafferty visited the White House a combined 69 times, meeting personally with President Bush in eight of those visits.

In June 2014, state Rep. Paul “Skip” Stam (R-N.C.) distributed a TVC flier that compared being lesbian or gay to mental disorders such as apotemnophilia (sexual arousal associated with an amputee's stump) and coprophilia (sexual arousal associated with feces). The same language was included in Scott Lively’s 2009 book Redeeming the Rainbow: A Christian Response to the “Gay Agenda.” Lively is best known for an infamous book wrongly blaming gay men for the Nazi Holocaust.

The TVC also has adopted Islamophobia in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. In 2008, Sheldon claimed “Islamists” want to destroy America and western civilization by “conquering nation after nation” and imposing Shariah religious law upon them. In 2010, Lafferty publicly opposed the planned Park51 mosque in Lower Manhattan, stating: “We cannot allow the standard for decision-making to become whether or not an action disappoints violent Muslim fanatics. We cannot give the homicide bombers a veto over the lives of free people.” Lafferty’s husband founded an anti-Muslim organization, the Virginia Anti-Shariah Law Task Force (VAST).

In 2011, the TVC started a grassroots campaign called “The Task Force to Stop Shariah Law.” It was intended to raise over $3 million to educate and mobilize Americans against Shariah law, launch a website for the campaign, train pastors and activists to confront the “Shariah threat,” and cover Lafferty’s travel expenses so that she can lobby against Shariah law across the country. In its campaign mailings, the TVC falsely claimed “Shariah Law trumps the law of any land – including our own Constitution” and that Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan “believes in Shariah Law and has actively worked to advance it the United States” because she allegedly pushed for the establishment of the “The Islamic Legal Studies Program,” funded with Saudi oil money, while she was the dean of Harvard Law School. Later in 2011, the TVC co-hosted a conference called “The Constitution of Sharia – Preserving Freedom Conference” in Nashville, Tenn., with other far-right groups.

In 2012, VAST and the TVC launched a smear campaign against the Islamic Society of North America Convention (ISNA), an important event in the American Muslim calendar. Both organizations published an article titled “ISNA Convention Offers Two Views of Islam – the Manufactured Public Persona and the Truth.” VAST and TVC have jointly tried to portray ISNA as a subversive organization on the basis of “several key briefings and meetings.” They claimed that ISNA discourages fellow Muslims from talking to the FBI. VAST and the TVC also attacked immigration lawyer Rabia Chaudry, a member of the ACLU board of directors and president of the Safe Nation Collaborative, for talking about the negative impact of the New York City Police Department’s controversial spying on the Muslim community.

That same year, Jim Lafferty pushed the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in Virginia to reject the proposed renewal of the Islamic Saudi Academy’s building lease. Lafferty said the Islamic Saudi Academy, an elite college prep school, is an “incubator for a new generation of domestic terrorists,” funded and owned by the Saudi government. (The valedictorian of the school’s 1999 class was convicted on charges of supporting Al-Qaeda in 2005. Local residents began protesting the renewal of the Islamic Saudi Academy’s building lease in 2010.) The Saudi government, according to Lafferty, has shown “no interest in cleaning up the pro-violence, anti-Semitic, and anti-Christian teaching and textbooks.”

In 2013, VAST and other “pro-freedom organizations” hosted a press conference at a Muslim cemetery in Caroline County, near Richmond, the burial site of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev. At the conference, Lafferty said Tsarnev’s burial at the cemetery was “an awful sneak attack on the people of Virginia.”

Jim Lafferty is also the executive director of the Christian Seniors Association (CSA), a front group started by the TVC as a “strong conservative Christian alternative to the ultra-left AARP,” formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons. The CSA has a longstanding history of producing fear-mongering fundraising letters, some of which resemble government documents. In 2006, for instance, the CSA mailed out fake “U.S. Taxpayer Census” forms, which included a survey about Social Security and ominous warnings about politicians who promote a far-left agenda that hurts seniors. Two years later, the CSA again sent out these bogus forms, which many seniors believed were actual government documents. In 2010, the CSA sent out a survey with a letter asking for donations to combat the AARP and Obama’s “socialist” agenda. In 2011, the CSA mailed a fundraising letter to its members alleging the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, which made sexual orientation a protected class under federal hate crime legislation, “makes the Bible illegal hate literature.” Although other religious right groups have made similar claims, or at least said the federal hate crime statute could have such an effect, the claims are universally false.

In 2014, Lafferty said Hobby Lobby’s challenge to the contraception coverage mandate in Obamacare was essential in stopping the Obama administration and Planned Parenthood’s “agenda of population control.” She claimed that that effort was part of a larger attack by “Islamic Shariah law both at home and abroad.”

Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.""

If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release. 

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.

EmmaBest,Ware Group,No Responsive Documents,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/ware-group-39802/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning the Ware group, which was a covert organization of Communist Party USA operatives within the United States government in the 1930s, run first by Harold Ware (1889–1935) and then by Whittaker Chambers (1901–1961) after Ware's accidental death on August 13, 1935. The first known meeting of the Ware Group occurred in late 1933 with eight members: John Abt, Henry Collins, Alger Hiss, Victor Perlo, Lee Pressman, Nathaniel Weyl, and Nathan Witt. Initially, Peters instructed that members make ""exceptional money sacrifices"" to the Party, study Marxist theory and Party doctrine, observe ""strictest secrecy,"" and to obtain ""any government documents"" available to them. (Known members laters claimed that theirs was merely a ""Marxist study group.)

By 1934, the group had grown to some 75 members, divided into cells. Members initially joined Marxist study groups and then into activities on behalf of the Party. They shared a belief that Marxist ideologies were the correct way to approach the problems of the ongoing Great Depression. Whittaker Chambers also stated that Ware could have been acting ""pursuant to orders from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the United States"". The Ware group started among young lawyers and economists hired by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA). This New Deal agency reported to the Secretary of Agriculture but was operated independently of Department of Agriculture bureaucracy. All the members of the Ware Group were dues paying members of the Communist Party. J. Peters considered the Ware Group one of his major sources of income. Nathaniel Weyl felt that members of the Ware Group were acquiring ""the training in the complex business of running a state that would be in high demand and short supply when the United States chose Socialism"", that ""in a Communist regime they would be poised to move to the head of the table.""

Alleged members of the Ware Group included:

J. Peters
Harold Ware
Whittaker Chambers
John Abt
Lee Pressman
George Silverman
Victor Perlo
Alger Hiss
Charles Kramer
Nathan Witt
Henry Collins
Marion Bachrach
John Herrmann
Nathaniel Weyl
Donald Hiss
Hope Hale Davis
Harry Dexter White

To clarify, the intent of this request is for files relating to the activities of the group. At this time, there's no need to provide the full files on the group's individual alleged members. 

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.",1379808-000,False,1436,1302,,,0.00,2017-07-11 04:00:00+00:00,,,ware-group-39802

Formed as a racist response to the Black Lives Matter movement, White Lives Matter (WLM) describes itself as “dedicated to promotion of the white race and taking positive action as a united voice against issues facing our race,” in the words of its website. “The fiber and integrity our nation was founded on is being unraveled … [by] homosexuality and [racially] mix[ed] relationships,” it says. “Illegal immigration, healthcare, housing, welfare, employment, education, social security, our children, our veterans and active military and their rights … are the issues we face as white Americans. The laws and immoral orders the current [Obama] administration are passing are drastically … targeting everything the white way of life holds dear.”

Although it’s not easy to track WLM’s precise evolution and leadership structure, two white supremacists and the Texas-based Aryan Renaissance Society, a neo-Nazi group, appear to be the main players behind it, hosting WLM rallies and engaging in WLM flier distributions across the nation since 2015.

Rebecca Barnette, a self-described homemaker from Surgoinsville, Tenn., has said she is one of WLM’s co-founders, and she has probably done more than anyone to spread its message. A veteran of a string of neo-Nazi groups, Barnette simultaneously holds the post of director of the Women’s Division of the National Socialist Movement (NSM), which is currently the largest neo-Nazi organization in America. She describes herself as a “revolutionist” working to “create a new world” for white people.

And Barnette doesn’t hold back. She has claimed that Jews and Muslims are allies in an effort “to commit genocide of epic proportions” against white people. In a particularly bloodthirsty post on her page on vk.com, a Russian social networking site favored by white supremacists for its lack of censorship, she wrote that it is time for “the blood of our enemies [to] soak our soil to form new mortar to rebuild our landmasses.”

Barnette first appeared as a WLM activist after she ran a social media campaign against a planned Black Lives Matter rally near Johnson City, Tenn., in August 2015, telling the Johnson City Press she was a local representative of WLM and the Aryan Renaissance Society (ARS). (She has since left the ARS.) The newspaper quoted a post of hers saying that she was part of “a small army ready to blow their little party out of the water … in the proper way… the white.”

Barnette has moved around the white supremacist scene a fair amount, jumping from the ARS to the racist skinhead group Aryan Strikeforce and then, in 2016, to the leadership of the NSM’s Women’s Division. On April 23, 2016, she attended an annual event in Rome, Ga., that was hosted by the National Socialist Movement. She has tried to bring unity to the fractured racist world, encouraging “a unified voice against a tyrannical reign of government” and deriding “a bunch of idiots in my own race that care more about fighting amongst each other … than to stand as a people.” Apparently pursuing that goal, Barnette brought WLM into the neo-Nazi Aryan Nationalist Alliance, a coalition of 24 white supremacist groups.

Barnette is not the only prominent WLM activist.

Connecticut resident Kevin Harris, identified as another WLM co-founder, has also openly displayed his white supremacist beliefs, sporting white supremacist symbols on his clothing. One of the patches on his black jacket includes the White Pride World Wide symbol, which is the main logo for Stormfront, the largest white supremacist web forum in the world. Another displays the number 1488. That is a common neo-Nazi symbol that references the “The 14 Words” white supremacist slogan (“We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White children,” coined by David Lane, who died in prison while serving a 190-year sentence for his part in the assassination of a Jewish talk show host) and “Heil Hitler” (H is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and so 88 stands for HH, which in turn stands for Heil Hitler).

Harris, who says his work is “to raise awareness of the Caucasian genocide,” has regularly posted videos of himself passing out WLM fliers in grocery store parking lots on a WLM YouTube channel. (Another activist on that YouTube channel has asked supporters to collect box tops to support public schools as a way of gaining influence even though he described them as “Communist reprogramming centers.”)

Meanwhile, the Aryan Renaissance Society, which is based in Texas, has also adopted WLM ideas and worked to spread them.

On Aug. 21, 2016, ARS National Director Ken Reed organized a rally attacking the NAACP in Houston, complete with “White Lives Matter” placards, that drew national press attention to the movement for the first time. Reed’s group describes itself as “one of the founders of the White Lives Matter movement sweeping the country” and ARS members have been identified as the “go-to person[s] for all things White Lives Matter,” according to a 2015 posting on the WLM Facebook page. Reed is an administrator of that page along with ARS member Scott Lacy. ARS members have also posted videos on the WLM Facebook profile teaching people how to distribute WLM fliers in their communities.

Doug Chism, the president of ARS, has erected a large “White Lives Matter” billboard in front of his home in Texas City, Texas.

Elsewhere, ARS has described itself as a “network of dedicated White Separatists diligently striving to impart a New Racial Consciousness to Aryankind.” It hopes to create “an Aryan oligarchy based on genetic aristocracy” to “enhance the Race.” The overall idea, ARS has said, is to protect threatened white people from genocide and the “bastardization of the white race” through interbreeding. In one of its fliers, ARS wrote: “More whites die everyday through interracial offspring than the wars, abortions, accidents, and natural deaths put together. We must live geographically separated from other races with strict border control!!!!”

The ARS website was taken down in August 2016, shortly after gaining national headlines after its protest against the NAACP. But before that, it was thick with celebratory photos of Nazi soldiers. In addition, Reed and other ARS members have posted group photos showing them giving the Nazi salute, while other members have posted photos of themselves, and sometimes their children, sieg-heiling in front of Nazi flags.

ARS first started posting WLM fliers on light posts and bus stops in the summer of 2015. After the murder of Harris County (Texas) Sheriff’s Deputy Darren Goforth in August 2015, members also held up WLM signs as a funeral procession for the fallen deputy passed by.

Another key player in the WLM is Greg Calhoun, an Atlanta Klansman who in June 2016 described himself as a WLM contact, asking “anyone in Georgia and Alabama that wants to be involved with White Lives Matter to please contact” him.

The WLM website, apparently managed by Barnette, urges activists to grow the movement, much as white supremacists in the last several years have worked to seed the idea in the political mainstream that white people are being subjected to genocide. The site asks supporters to find “like-minded people” and organize groups to attend school board and local town council meetings, arrange neighborhood block parties “to discuss the problems affecting our community,” and to “find out who your local state rep is” in order to confront them about issues of illegal immigration and health care.

Since 2015, WLM fliers, reading “It’s Not Racist to Love Your People” and carrying the hashtag #whitelivesmatter, have been posted on bathroom walls, light posts and bus stops from Utah to Connecticut. Some incorporate language about black-on-white crime, a reminder of the racist Council of Conservative Citizens website that is obsessed with the same topic and inspired the racist 2015 massacre of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., by Dylann Roof.

Other racist groups that have joined the movement include the Golden State Skins, a racist skinhead group that says it distributed WLM fliers around Sacramento, Calif., on Sept. 6, 2015.

Melissa Dennis, a California woman who is a contact for the Noble Breed Kindred racist group, has designed and sold WLM T-shirts and stickers to raise funds for other racist groups. She joined a “flier drop” where activists distributed WLM propaganda on Jan. 9, 2016, as part of what was billed as a national anti-Muslim event. (On the same day, Billy Roper, a well-known racist leader, pasted up fliers in Harrison, Ark.) Dennis also sold WLM T-shirts at a June 25, 2016, Aryan Nationalist Alliance meeting in Salem, Ohio, according to a web posting.

One of the more noticeable early appearances of the WLM movement came on Feb. 27, 2016, when a car containing six Klansmen bearing “White Lives Do Matter” signs arrived at a park in Anaheim, Calif., to protest “illegal immigration and Muslims.” Counter-protesters set upon the Klansmen, who stabbed three people, one of them critically. Although police initially arrested five Klan members, they later released them because they apparently were acting in self-defense. Several anti-racist protesters were charged for their roles in the violence.

Another racist group, the Traditionalist Workers Party (TWP) led by Matthew Heimbach, co-hosted a “White Lives Matter/Blue Lives Matter” demonstration with the ARS in Dallas shortly after the murder of five police officers there in early July 2016. But Kevin Harris, one of WLM’s co-founders, seemed less than supportive of “blue lives” — he posted a photo of himself in front of a police car with his middle finger extended. Rebecca Barnette sounded similar, writing that “[w]hile White Lives Matter supports law and order and feels the terroristic attacks on law enforcement officers is a tragedy, we are not proponents for blue lives matter.”

Chris Johnson, a TWP organizer who attended the Dallas rally, posted a photo of himself holding a Karabiner 98k rifle, once the standard weapon of the German Wehrmacht, saying he was “Defending Faith, Family, and Folk with a K98K.”

The WLM message is spreading.

In July 2016, members of the white supremacist Aryan Nations Worldwide held up signs near Temple, Ga., reading “White Lives Matter” and “Only White Lives Matter.” Keystone United, a Pennsylvania-based racist skinhead group, advertises its own WLM stickers. And Tightrope, a white power music label, sells WLM T-shirts as part of its array of white supremacist merchandise.

The events took place on the night of May 21, 1979 (the night before what would have been Milk's 49th birthday) in San Francisco. Earlier that day, White had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter, the lightest possible conviction for his actions. That White was not convicted of first-degree murder (of which he was originally charged) had so outraged the city's gay community that it set off the most violent reaction by gay Americans since the 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City (which is credited as the beginning of the modern gay rights movement in the United States).

At the outbreak of war in September 1939 Sargant returned to Britain to find that the Maudsley had been evacuated and divided into two—one half going to Mill Hill School in North London and the other half setting up a hospital in the old Belmont Workhouse near Sutton, Surrey. Sargant was sent, along with H.J. Shorvon, clinical director Eliot Slater, and medical superintendent Louis Minski to Belmont workhouse—renamed the Sutton Emergency Medical Service (in 1953 the name of the hospital would revert to Belmont).

After the war, Sargant found it difficult to settle at the re-united Maudsley Hospital and applied – unsuccessfully – for positions elsewhere.[18] In 1947 he was invited to spend a year as a visiting professor of psychiatry at Duke University.",1374985-000,False,1488,1020,,,0.00,2017-05-20 04:00:00+00:00,2017-06-19,2017-06-05 00:00:00+00:00,william-sargant-35444

Mr. Israel's death is widely known and widely reported, including in statements on his own social media profile (https://www.facebook.com/michael.israel.92?fref=ts), the Kurdish military unit he died fighting alongside (https://it-it.facebook.com/YPG/posts/1290125934342333:0), and several media outlets:

- https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article118279143.html

Mr. Israel was a longtime labor organizer and political activist in central California. He graduated from Mountain Oaks High School in Amador County, California (http://www.calaverasenterprise.com/news/article_6354972a-b7f5-11e6-b24f-5f61f4e3138a.html) and set off on a 3,000-mile “March for Peace” from San Francisco to Washington, D.C. the day after his his 18th birthday, along with a friend named Ashley Casale (https://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/content/a-death-in-syria-michael-israels-quest-for-peace/23845661/). Mr. Israel's activism continued continued through the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, during which Mr. Israel was arrested several times for civil disobedience (https://thenaka.org/the-martyrdom-of-robin-agiri/). Mr. Israel was recruited by Amador County labor activists Jimmy Laughton and Steve Wilinsky to help with a labor campaign associated with the Service Employees International Union in early 2013 (https://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/content/a-death-in-syria-michael-israels-quest-for-peace/23845661/). He eventually became a member of the Sacramento chapter of the Industrial Workers of the World (https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article118279143.html) as well as co-chair of the Sacramento chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (https://sacramentodsa.nationbuilder.com/statement_in_remembrance_of_michael_israel) from 2013-2014.

In 2012, Mr. Israel met Delmer Berg, an American veteran of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion during the Spanish Civil War (https://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/content/a-death-in-syria-michael-israels-quest-for-peace/23845661/). Inspired by foreign fighters like Mr. Berg, Mr. Israel told a friend named Jaki Montañez in mid-2015 that he was planning to join a Syrian Kurdish militia called the People's Defense Units (YPG). Mr. Israel served several months in the war against Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL) and returned from Syria on or before November 15, 2015. He spent time with the California Kurdish Community Center near San Francisco, protested against racially-charged comments by a planning commissioner at the Calaveras County Board of Supervisors in March 2016, and participated in antifascist protests in Sacramento in July 2016. Mr. Israel returned to northern Syria around September 2016 (https://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/content/a-death-in-syria-michael-israels-quest-for-peace/23845661/). He died in a Turkish airstrike outside the city of Manbij during combat operations against Islamic State, as several media outlets and the YPG itself reported.

Mr. Israel's friends, family, and fellow activists welcomed his remains back to San Francisco International Airport with a funeral motorcade (https://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/content/a-death-in-syria-michael-israels-quest-for-peace/23845661/). Mourners held a rally for Mr. Israel at the Turkish Consulate-General in New York City on March 24, 2017 (https://www.facebook.com/events/turkish-consulate-general-in-new-york-tc-new-york-ba%C5%9Fkonsoloslu%C4%9Fu/vigil-and-rally-for-michael-israel-american-activist-and-ypg-freedom-fighter-kil/1898555620391320/) and may have rallied outside of other Turkish diplomatic posts as well.
