Note that merely searching the CRS may not be sufficient.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

FFATA and DATA REQUEST 

EFOIA Request

Fee waiver requested 

Dear Information Officer:  
Pursuant to The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act and The Digital  Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014, I request access to and copies of:  
 
All expense reports and or records for travel to Las Vegas, Nevada for the  dates September 16, 2020 to December 27, 2020, 2020 generated by any FBI Offices.   Including but not limited to expenses reimbursed for activity in the state.

Please produce the records pursuant to FFATA and DATA.  

Please release any records for any closed fiscal quarter on a rolling basis as available.  
I would like to receive the information in EFOIA style for electronic communication and  production. Please produce the documents in .pdf format via email. 

Fee Categorization  
For fee categorization purposes, I am a representative of the news media. Through this  request, I am gathering information for my journalistic work with Muckrock.com. I am an active  participant in the dissemination of public records for public education purposes. Accordingly, I  am only required to pay for the direct cost of duplication after the first 100 pages. 5 U.S.C. §  552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II); id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iv)(II).  Generally, not applicable for EFOIA request.

Request for Fee Waiver  
Please waive any applicable fees. The release of the information is not primarily in my  commercial interest and will contribute significantly to public understanding of government  operations and activities. Due to the pandemic and the 'essential vs. non-essential travel' and  the stringent Governors guidelines and restrictions in relation to the prevention of COVID via  mandatory quarantine periods etc., the request has overwhelming public interest.  

Conclusion  
If my request is denied in whole or part, please justify all withholdings by reference to specific  exemptions and statutes, as applicable. For each withholding please also explain why your  agency “reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an  exemption” or why “disclosure is prohibited by law.

See the following article on Chamran's posthumous biography: http://www.taghribnews.com/en/news/98998/martyr-chamran-s-biography-book-unveiled

Chamran, born in Tehran, Iran, moved to the United States in the late 1950s for higher education. He obtained an M.S. degree from the Texas A&M University, and a PhD in electrical engineering and plasma physics in 1963 from the University of California, Berkeley. He also claims in his autobiography that he was hired as research staff scientist at Bell Laboratories and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the 1960s. Chamran married Tamsen Heiman, an American Muslim, in 1961. They had one daughter Roushan and three sons Ali, Jamal and Rahim. Heiman died in 2009.

Chamran was also a member of the Freedom Movement of Iran (FMI) — also known as the Liberation Movement of Iran (LMI) — led by Mehdi Bazargan, and spent some time in Cuba to receive military training.

In December 1963, Chamran left the United States for Egypt, where he was trained in guerrilla warfare and founded an anti-Shah organization called the Special Organization for Unity and Action. In 1965, he returned to the United States and founded a political group called Red Shiism along with his brother Mehdi Chamran Save'ei, who later became head of Iranian external intelligence. In 1968, Chamran founded another political group, the Muslim Students' Association of America along with Ebrahim Yazdi. In 1971, he left the United States for possibly the last time, traveling to Lebanon in order to fight alongside the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Amal Movement. He trained militants in Algeria, Egypt, and Syria.

Chamran was heavily involved in Iranian politics during and after the 1979 revolution. He was a close confidant of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. During the revolution, Bazargan became prime minister and Chamran served as deputy prime minister in his cabinet. Chamran led military operations against Kurdish rebels and served as minister of defense from September 1979 to 1980. In March 1980, he was elected to the Iranian parliament (Majlis) as a Tehran representative. In May 1980, he was named Khomeini's representative to the Supreme Council of National Defense. Chamran then led the Irregular Warfare Headquarters in the Iran-Iraq War and was killed in Dehlavieh on 21 June 1981, after which he was eulogized by Khomeini as ""a proud commander of Islam.""

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.

It is noted for its legal victories against white supremacist groups, its classification of hate groups and other extremist organizations, its legal representation for victims of hate groups, and its educational programs that promote tolerance.  The SPLC's classification and listing of hate groups -- organizations that in its opinion ""attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics"" -- has been the source of some controversy.

The Southern Poverty Law Center was founded by civil rights lawyers Morris Dees and Joseph J. Levin Jr. in 1971 as a law firm originally focused on issues such as fighting poverty, discrimination and the death penalty in the United States. The SPLC's first president was Julian Bond, who served as president until 1979 and remained on its board of directors until his death on August 15, 2015. In 1979, Dees decided to begin monitoring far-right groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, sharing their observations with law enforcement agencies (which, after the COINTELPRO program was revealed, were forbidden from monitoring such groups without evidence of criminal activity) and suing them for monetary damages on behalf of their victims.

In November 2013, computer hacker Jeremy Hammond was sentenced to ten years in federal prison for his role in the Anonymous attack. An FBI informant, Hector Xavier Monsegur (also known as ""Sabu""), initially faced 124 years in prison for his role in the attack, but his sentence was reduced to time served plus one year's supervised release in May 2014. WikiLeaks announced the initial publication of more than five million of Stratfor's e-mail messages on February 26, 2012. Anonymous claimed to have provided WikiLeaks with the data.

According to Soufan, a friend at CTC faxed him a document ""a few months"" after the 2004 trial of Al Qaeda suspects in Yemen. Soufan writes on page 508 of The Black Banners Declassified:

“It was a memo from the CIA chief in Sanaa to CTC headquarters, reporting that Ambassador Hull had suggested that I go to Yemen to help with the investigation of USS Cole subjects who had escaped from prison in April 2003. (Ten al-Qaeda members, including Jamal al-Badawi, had escaped. They were caught the following year.) Hull had made the recommendation based upon my close relationship with General Qamish and other senior Yemeni officials. The CIA chief registered his disagreement, asking the ambassador to change his request. The Yemenis didn’t like me, the CIA chief claimed, because I had 'demanded access to people in al-Mukalla.' I had never been to al-Mukalla and knew that the CIA chief, the same person who had blocked us from breaking up the Limburg plot, was making up lies about me.
“I gave the memo to my FBI superiors, who demanded an apology from the CIA and a retraction. No official apology came, and instead a CIA official went to the FBI representative at the CTC and said, 'We made a mistake.'”

Please note that the memo is mentioned in both the 2011 and 2020 editions of Soufan's book, each of which underwent prepublication review by the CIA.

If any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.

I request that I be properly classified as a media requester.

EmmaBest,VDARE,Awaiting Appeal,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/vdare-31276/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning VDARE, VDARE.com or the VDARE Foundation. Originally established in 1999 by the Center for American Unity, a Virginia-based nonprofit foundation started by English immigrant Peter Brimelow, VDARE.com is an anti-immigration hate website ""dedicated to preserving our historical unity as Americans into the 21st Century.""

Founded in 1999 by anti-immigrant activist and author Peter Brimelow, the Center for American Unity has served to promote the work of white supremacists, anti-Semites and others on the radical right. This is most obvious in VDARE.com, which the foundation started in 1999 and funded until 2007. It is named after Virginia Dare, said to be the first English child born in the New World, in 1587. Brimelow says that he once planned to bestow Dare’s name upon ""the heroine of a projected fictional concluding chapter in Alien Nation [his best selling anti-immigration book], about the flight of the last white family in Los Angeles.""

VDARE.com was an idea that Brimelow says ""flowed out of a best-selling book I wrote back in 1995(!), Alien Nation. … Like the immigration reform movement in general, it is a coalition, agreed only on the need for immigration reduction."" While Brimelow vehemently denies that the site is white nationalist, preferring instead ""politically incorrect,"" many of the articles published there contain typical white nationalist themes; Brimelow also concedes that he does publish some ""white nationalist"" authors, like Jared Taylor of American Renaissance magazine. They decry the demise of white America, blaming immigrants, multiculturalists, and members of the ""Treason Lobby"" — essentially groups concerned with protecting immigrants’ human and civil rights — for undermining the racial cohesion of the nation. Reflecting this position, VDARE.com’s archives contain articles like ""Freedom vs. Diversity,"" ""Abolishing America,"" ""Anarcho-Tyranny — Where Multiculturalism Leads"" and ""Why Immigrants Kill.""

VDARE also publishes essays by prominent academic racists. For example, a column by Jared Taylor, who has argued elsewhere that black people are incapable of maintaining any kind of civilization, dismisses ""the fantasy of racial equality,"" claims the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ""stripped Americans of the right to make free decisions,"" and says that ""[b]lacks, in particular, riot with little provocation,"" unlike the far more peaceable white race. He has also published pieces by J. Philippe Rushton, the head of the Pioneer Fund, which gives financial backing to academics who specialize in race and IQ studies.

While acknowledging that his site hosts ""white nationalists"" like Taylor, Brimelow argues that they are merely people who ""aim to defend the interests of American whites. They are not white supremacists. They do not advocate violence. They are rational and civil. They brush their teeth. But they unashamedly work for their people."" Brimelow goes on to say that as dark-skinned immigration from the Third World continues, ""this type of interest-group ‘white nationalism’ will inexorably increase."" What Brimelow doesn’t mention is that VDARE.com also posts stories by one of the most important anti-Semites in America, Kevin MacDonald, a professor of psychology at the California State University, Long Beach. MacDonald believes Jews are genetically driven to undermine the power of whites by pushing such things as Third World immigration.

Other authors listed on VDARE.com’s website as part of its ""editorial collective"" as of 2008 include Thomas Allen, Bryanna Bevens, John Brimelow (brother of Peter), Randall Burns, Joseph Fallon, James Fulford, Joe Guzzardi, Athena Kerry, D.A. King, Juan Mann, Paul Craig Roberts, Steve Sailer, Howard Sutherland, Brenda Walker, Allan Wall, John Wall, and Chilton Williamson Jr.

The VDARE.com website also serves as a repository for an archive of nativist columns by the white nationalist movement’s foremost intellectual, Sam Francis, the immigrant-bashing editor of the newspaper of the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens who died in 2005. In his columns, Francis rails against the ""emerging Hispanic majority,"" plugs conspiracy theories, and promotes white racial consciousness.

In 2007, VDARE.com and the Center for America Unity parted ways. The website notes that ""VDARE.COM is no longer associated with the Center For American Unity, which plans to focus on litigation,"" in place, presumably, of nativist propaganda and opinion. In the center’s stead, Brimelow created the VDARE Foundation, a 501(c)3 charity, to serve as the website’s sponsor. However, as a July 4, 2008, desperate plea from Brimelow for donations and volunteer staff members suggests, funding in the future might prove to be a challenge.

Brimelow spent much of 2009 pounding the white nationalists message that the Republican Party would do better to spend its time attracting white voters rather than by reaching out to minorities. Brimelow took that message to hard right groups as well as expounding the idea on his website. In ""Yes, It Is about Race. Quite right, too,"" Brimelow explained the ""tea party"" movements and the furor found at town halls in the summer of 2009 as being ""about race"" and pointing out that ""the backlash [against the Obama administration] is overwhelmingly white.""
