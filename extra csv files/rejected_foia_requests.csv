EmmaBest,America's Most Wanted,Rejected,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/americas-most-wanted-43835/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records mentioning or relating to the show America's Most Wanted, including any FBI coordination with the show and reports of cases closed and fugitives captured with the help of the show. 

The concept for America's Most Wanted originally came from a German show, Aktenzeichen XY ... ungelöst (German for File Reference XY ... Unsolved), that first aired in 1967, and the British show Crimewatch, first aired in 1984, with the US version conceived by Fox executive Stephen Chao and Executive Producer Michael Linder in the summer of 1987. Even earlier, however, CBS aired a three-month half-hour similar series hosted by Walter McGraw in the 1955-1956 season entitled Wanted.

While Linder was shooting the pilot episode in Indiana, Chao and Fox attorney Tom Herwitz conducted a hurried search for a host. Chao's first choice was former police officer and best-selling author Joseph Wambaugh, but Wambaugh refused, saying he didn't believe a national dragnet would work in the United States. Chao also considered asking recently resigned U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, former Virginia governor Chuck Robb and former Oklahoma governor Bob Curry before deciding a politician might use the show as a platform for personal political ambitions. Other potential candidates included former Marine Corps Commandant General P. X. Kelly, journalists Linda Ellerbee and Bob Woodward, and victims' advocate Theresa Saldana. Then, during a marathon telephone conference call, Herwitz suggested John Walsh. Walsh had gained publicity after his six-year-old son, Adam Walsh, was kidnapped and murdered in 1981. The crime had been the subject of the 1983 television film Adam, and Walsh's later advocacy had resulted in new legislation to protect missing children, as well as the creation of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. After lengthy discussions, Walsh agreed to host the pilot episode.

America's Most Wanted debuted as a half-hour program on February 7, 1988 on seven Fox-owned stations. Within four days of the first broadcast, FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitive David James Roberts was captured as a direct result. He was a convicted killer who had recently escaped from prison by digging his way out with a small axe. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the show's ""Watch Television, Catch Criminals"" premise to skeptical law enforcement agencies. Ten weeks later, the program premiered nationwide on the Fox network and became the fledgling network's first hit series. In 1990, the show's format was changed from 30 minutes to 60 minutes. The show was cut back to 30 minutes in 1995, and back to 60 minutes in 1996. From 1995 to 1996, a short-lived syndicated spinoff titled America's Most Wanted: Final Justice aired.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.","1386242-000, DOJ-AP-2018-003505",False,1361,1055,,,0.00,2017-09-24 04:00:00+00:00,2018-02-12,2018-07-27 17:07:03.234861+00:00,americas-most-wanted-43835

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.

Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.

Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.

As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.",1435466-000,False,780,687,,,0.00,2019-04-28 00:54:32.657262+00:00,,2019-07-30 20:01:53.539767+00:00,anonsec-nasa-hoax-72287

EmmaBest,Aryan Nations,Rejected,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/aryan-nations-31217/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning Aryan Nations. In its heyday in the 1980s and early 1990s, neo-Nazis, racist skinheads, Klansmen and other white nationalists convened regularly at the group’s Idaho compound for its annual world congresses. In 2000, AN began to fall apart after losing a civil lawsuit brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center that depleted the group’s finances. The physical decline and 2004 death of AN founder Richard Butler further devastated the group. In the latter part of the 2000s, Aryan Nations splintered into a handful of groups with several people vying for leadership of the various factions. 

Richard Butler founded Aryan Nations, but William Potter Gale and Wesley Swift were its inspirations. Butler was living in Southern California after World War II when he met Gale, a retired Army colonel who had been on the staff of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. Gale eventually introduced Butler to the Posse Comitatus, a militia-type antigovernment movement that promoted racist and anti-Semitic views. Butler began attending a Christian Identity church where Swift, a Gale acolyte, was pastor. Swift preached the two-seedline theory of Christian Identity, meaning the view that whites are the true Israelites and Jews are descended directly from a sexual union between Eve and Satan. Butler studied privately with Swift, absorbing his church’s ideology.

Swift formed the virulently anti-Semitic Christian Defense League in 1962, and Butler served as its national director until 1965. Meanwhile, Butler took a theological correspondence course and became an ordained Identity minister. 

Butler openly admired Adolf Hitler and longed for a whites-only homeland in the Pacific Northwest. He retired as an aeronautical engineer at age 55 and moved to Hayden Lake, Idaho, in 1974. There, he bought an old farmhouse and formed his own  ""Christian Posse Comitatus"" group. By 1977, Butler had decided to form the Church of Jesus Christ Christian at the farmhouse, and named its political arm Aryan Nations.

In 1980, Butler’s church was bombed, causing $80,000 in damage. Nobody was injured or arrested. Butler responded by building a two-story guard tower and posting armed guards around his 20-acre property. 

In 1981, Butler hosted the first of what would be many annual Aryan World Congress gatherings on his property. It, and the confabs that would follow, attracted almost every nationally significant racist leader around. Among them: Tom Metzger, former Klansman and leader of White Aryan Resistance; Louis Beam, another onetime Klansman who promoted the concept of leaderless resistance; Don Black, the former Klansman who created Stormfront, the oldest and largest white nationalist forum on the Web; and Kirk Lyons, a lawyer who has represented several extremists and who was married on the compound by Butler.

Butler’s most infamous acolyte was probably Robert J. Mathews, founder of The Order, a white supremacist domestic terrorist group that committed crimes, including the theft of $3.6 million from an armored car, to fund a hoped-for race war. Members of The Order also murdered Denver talk radio host Alan Berg. Many members of The Order first met at the Aryan Nations compound, and initially sought to finance their efforts by printing counterfeit money on Aryan Nations’ presses. Butler later denied any knowledge of this.

In addition to the murder of Berg, Aryan Nations followers and sympathizers committed other violent crimes. An Aryan Nations and Order member named David Tate shot and killed a state trooper in Missouri in 1985. That same year, the compound’s security chief, Elden ""Bud"" Cutler, was arrested for trying to hire a hit man to kill an FBI informant who was part of an investigation of The Order.

The government had wanted for some time to charge Butler — whose group had a longstanding practice of distributing literature to prison inmates and corresponding with them — in connection with crimes committed by some of his followers, in particular those perpetrated by members of The Order. A grand jury in Fort Smith, Ark., indicted him and 13 others on sedition charges in 1987, saying the men were ""godfathers"" of a conspiracy hatched at the 1983 Aryan World Congress. Charges against one defendant were dropped. The others were all acquitted at trial.

Butler commemorated Hitler’s 100th birthday in April 1989 by inviting racist skinheads to Aryan Nations for a celebration that included performances by white power skinhead bands. This was the beginning of a campaign to recruit younger whites into the movement. Earlier in the 1980s, as the Aryan Nations grew, Butler had already created a structure for the group by creating state chapters and appointing leaders to head them. 

In the 1990s, however, problems began to bedevil Aryan Nations. Several key members left the group and joined splinter organizations. Butler’s associate pastor, Carl Franklin, for example, left in 1993, taking with him the group’s security chief. Butler had publicly picked Franklin to succeed him, only to change his mind. Franklin went to Montana, where the two men formed another white supremacist group. 

In December 1995, Butler’s wife died from cancer. Butler himself was now 77 and hardly in robust health. By 1997, Aryan Nations had lost more than half its state chapters, retaining just 13. That year, Butler named his eventual successor, fellow Identity minister Neuman Britton of California. Britton was married to the widow of Gordon Kahl, a Posse Comitatus leader who killed two U.S. marshals in 1983 and was later killed himself in an Arkansas shootout.

Aryan Nations got plenty of bad publicity in 1998 when former Aryan Nations guard Buford O’Neal Furrow Jr. fired more than 70 rounds from a submachine gun at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles. He wounded five people, then drove off and shot and killed a Filipino-American postal worker. He eventually surrendered to the FBI in Las Vegas and is now serving a life sentence in prison. Furrow said at the time that he opened fire on the community center because he hated Jews, and that he would not have shot the postal worker had he been white. In 2009, he wrote a letter to a newspaper renouncing the racist views he held.

A month before the Furrow shootings, there was an even more pivotal event in the history of Aryan Nations. That’s when Butler’s security guards chased down a woman and her son after their car backfired while driving near the Aryan Nations compound. The guards forced their car into a ditch and assaulted them. The Southern Poverty Law Center sued on behalf of the victims, and in September 2000, a jury issued a judgment of $6.3 million against the defendants.

Butler was responsible for $4.8 million of the judgment because he had hired ex-convicts as guards, provided them no training and allowed them to carry assault weapons. Butler was forced to relinquish his 20-acre compound at a bankruptcy auction. The guard tower was subsequently demolished and the church and meeting hall burned to the ground during a firefighter drill. The property was bought by a philanthropist who turned it over to the North Idaho College Foundation. Butler remained in nearby Hayden, however, after a wealthy supporter bought him a house to live in.

Meanwhile, Neuman Britton died in 2001 without having served as leader. That year, Butler appointed Harold Ray Redfeairn of Ohio to one day replace him, even though Redfeairn had quit the group three years earlier after leading the Ohio chapter for six years. At the same time, Butler also promoted his webmaster, August Kreis III, to ""Minister of Information & Propaganda."" 

Redfeairn had an extensive criminal history that included a conviction for attempted aggravated murder in the near-fatal shooting of a Dayton, Ohio, police officer in 1979. After Butler anointed him as his heir apparent, Redfeairn and Kreis attempted a coup against him, and both were expelled. Redfeairn returned to the fold in 2002 and was reinstated as Butler’s successor. But, like Britton, he didn’t live long enough to lead Aryan Nations. He died of a heart attack in October 2003.

It was also in 2003 that the ailing Butler ran for mayor of Hayden. He garnered a little more than 2 percent of the vote. Two men who had recently moved into his home ran for city council seats and fared about as poorly.

Butler died in his sleep in September 2004. He was 86. Aryan Nations then split into two factions — one headed by Kreis in Pennsylvania and another by Jonathan Williams in Georgia. Although ideologically similar, Kreis differed from Williams on whether neo-Nazis could find common ground with Muslim terrorists, based on their common hatred of Jews. ""And I want to instill the same jihadic feeling in our peoples’ heart, in the Aryan race, that they [jihadists] have for their father, who they call Allah,"" Kreis told CNN in 2005. Neither Kreis nor Williams was able to return Aryan Nations to its former prominence. In 2005, Kreis moved to South Carolina, where he has recruited heavily among motorcycle gangs, and formed in 2010 the 1st SS Kavallerie Brigade Motorcycle Division as a kind of security crew. In 2009, Kreis claimed only two chapters and a handful of members. 

Williams and Clark ""Brother Laslo"" Patterson moved their faction to Alabama and renamed it the Aryan Nations/United Church of Yahweh. In 2007, the church dropped Aryan Nations from its name. Williams left the church the following year.

Other Aryan Nations splinter groups remain, apparently with little more than a website and/or relatively few members. Jerald O’Brien leads one such group. It was formerly based in Lincoln, Ala., and is now in the Coeur d’Alene, Idaho area. It claimed in 2009 to have four chapters. Another faction, headed by Jay Faber in New York and claiming to have 12 chapters in 2009, merged with O’Brien’s group in 2009/2010. Faber had previously been associated with Kreis’ faction. Elsewhere, longtime neo-Nazi Martin Linstedt started a one-chapter version of Aryan Nations in Missouri that he calls the Church of Jesus Christ Christian/Aryan Nations.

As of 2010, the most active and best organized of all the Aryan Nation offshoots appeared to be one headed by Paul Mullet. In February 2010, he and three other men showed up in John Day, Oregon, a town of fewer than 2,000 in the rural eastern part of that state, reportedly saying it would be ""the perfect place"" to establish a new Aryan Nations headquarters. John Day and nearby residents thought differently, with everyone from the mayor and the police chief to ranchers and business owners voicing their adamant opposition to neo-Nazis setting up shop in their town. Mullet then abandoned the idea.

Mullet’s group, based in 2009 in Chillicothe, Ohio, had 14 chapters. It added to its numbers in 2010 when the Maryland-based World Knights of the Ku Klux Klan disbanded and became part of Mullet’s Aryan Nations outfit.

The Mullet-led group busied itself in 2010, dropping flyers on people’s lawns in such far-flung places as West Virginia, California and Idaho — the latter inside plastic eggs on Easter morning. It also staged occasional rallies. One, at Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania in June 2010, saw the neo-Nazis’ dozen or so members vastly outnumbered by counter-demonstrators and police officers. The group staged another rally the following month in Pulaski, Tenn., where the Ku Klux Klan originated. Despite a modest and lethargic crowd, Mullet wrote on his website that ""this event was the best one that I myself have EVER attended!""

In late July 2010, Mullet announced on the Aryan Nations website that he was seeking donations to come up with a $5,000 deposit needed to buy 15 acres of land in southern Tennessee. The land, and a building on it, would serve, he said, as ""a new Aryan Republic Homeland."" By the end of 2010, Mullet had given up on the Aryan Nations and left the group, signing on with the American National Socialist Party. After Mullet left, his Aryan Nations faction was taken over by Morris Gulett, who has been active in the Aryan Nations since the 1990s.

A group of protesters went to Bureau of Indian Affairs offices at the national headquarters building, intending to negotiate for better housing on reservations and other issues. Protesters began the siege after interpreting a government refusal of their demands as a doublecross. Protesters began to vandalize the building in protest. They were not evicted on the first night. The takeover quickly gained national media attention.

Protesters overturned tables and desks against the windows, fortifying against potential police attack. Some set fires in interior offices and the marble lobbies, destroying many historic documents. The demonstrators started to run out of provisions after several days. They would not allow police or any government representative to approach the building, so two children of BIA employees were recruited to bring in provisions. After a week, the protesters left, some taking documents with them, having caused an estimated $700,000 in damages.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience.

Case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.

Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.""

""Mr. Gowdy.  Do you recall -- when I use the phrase ""crown material,"" what does that refer to?   

Mr. Comey.  I think it refers to material that -- now called the Steele dossier.  I mean, I could be wrong about that, but I think that's the name that the analysts use for that material. 

Mr. Gowdy.  I think you're correct.  So do you recall whether any, quote, crown material or dossier material was included in the IC assessment?   

Mr. Comey.  Yes.  I'm going to be careful here because I'm talking about a document that's still classified.  The unclassified thing we talked about earlier today, the first paragraph you can see of exhibit A, is reflective of the fact that at least some of the material that Steele had collected was in the big thing called the intelligence community assessment in an annex called annex A.

""Fox News was told that the email chain – not yet public -- referred to the dossier as ""crown material,"" but it was not clear why this apparent code was used. On Tuesday night, former GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy said on Fox News' ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"" that ""Comey has a better argument than Brennan, based on what I've seen.""

""Comey also told lawmakers on Dec. 17 that he recalled a discussion with Brennan about whether parts of the dossier should be included in the body of the ICA or in an appendix. When asked by Gowdy in that interview about his email to staff members, Comey said it was “possible” he sent an email but that he did not specifically recall. Gowdy then referred to the email, asking about the “crown material” reference and telling Comey that he had used the word “unverified” to describe the dossier.""

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ guidance, I meet all three standards for fee waivers.

Further, I ask that expediting be processed. The individual is known to have been associated with Donald Trump, as recorded by FBI memoranda (https://archive.org/details/DonaldTrumpTeamstersMemoFBI). This is of widespread public interest, as affirmed by the reporting from the mainstream media (https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/trumps-ties-to-an-informant-and-fbi-agent-reveal-his-modes-of-operation/2016/09/16/6e65522e-6f9f-11e6-9705-23e51a2f424d_story.html) and the individual's business ties to the President-Elect, his status as an informant and his ties to organized crime.

muira_mccammon,Deleted Tweets on @FBI,Rejected,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/deleted-tweets-on-fbi-93009/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Re: Freedom of Information Act Request 

Dear Freedom of Information Officer:

This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552, to the FBI on my own behalf as a journalist and as an academic researcher. 

Requested Records

I request all agency records from November 2008 to the present concerning Tweets deleted or drafted and not sent from the @FBI account associated with FBI. 
 
I believe the records that I are located, inter alia, within agency headquarters, in email records, and in third-party platforms used to manage the Agency’s social media accounts.

The records I request include, but are not limited to:
1.	Records of all tweets deleted by the Twitter handle associated with FBI, (@FBI), including:
a.	Any tweets that were published on Twitter and subsequently deleted for any reason; and
b.	Any tweets published by other accounts that were retweeted by @FBI and subsequently deleted for any reason.

2.	Records of all tweets that have been kept in draft form beyond their expected date and time of publication, on Twitter or in a third-party social media management platform, for any reason. 

3.	Records related to the drafting or deletion of tweets, including:
a.	Any correspondence or record of correspondence regarding the drafting or deletion of specific tweets
i.	including correspondence sent through official government email addresses or messaging services; and
ii.	including correspondence sent through private third-party services such as Gmail or Slack; and
iii.	Including any messages, notes, or annotations created on a third-party social media management platform.
b.	Documentation of the agency’s existing policy regarding the preservation and maintenance of tweets as per the Federal Records Act, and Federal Records Management Bulletin 2014-02 (available at https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2014/2014-02.htm), which stated that “social media content may be a Federal record when the use of social media provides added functionality, such as enhanced searchability, opportunities for public comment, or other collaboration… A complete Federal record must have content, context, and structure along with associated metadata (e.g., author, date of creation). The complete record must be maintained to ensure reliability and authenticity.”

c.	Any briefings, reports, memoranda, legal opinions, policy statements, or talking points used or disseminated within the Agency regarding the drafting or deletion of tweets.
I urge the FBI to process this request consistent with “a general philosophy of full agency disclosure [under FOIA] unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language,” United States Dep't of Def. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 510 U.S. 487, 494 (1994), and the Justice Department’s policy directing a presumption of disclosure. See Dep’t of Justice Office of Information Policy, President Obama’s FOIA Memorandum and Attorney General Holder’s FOIA Guidelines: Creating a “New Era of Open Government” (2009), available at https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-2009-creating-new-era-open-government). 

Request for Public Interest Fee Waiver

I request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested records is in the public interest. It “is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the activities or operations of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).
First, the records concern the operations or activities of the government. Government social media accounts are used to disseminated information to the public, make official pronouncements, and generally serve as an important touch point for governments to receive public input. See Social Media Use by Governments: A Policy Primer to Discuss Trends, Identify Policy Opportunities and Guide Decision Makers, OECD Working Papers on Public Governance, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jxrcmghmk0s-en. Social media use, including tweets posted by @FBI and then deleted, or never posted, is an important part of this activity.

Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. Specifically, the requested records will reveal substantial new information about how the FBI defines and manages tweets. They will allow the public to see what published messages have been rescinded and the process by which these public statements were retracted as compared to the processes employed by other agencies.  For example, my research on the Twitter account of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base revealed to the public that the account had systematically deleted controversial tweets. See Brady Dale, To What Extent is a Tweet a Federal Record?,  TECHNICAL.LY BROOKLYN (October 24, 2017), (https://technical.ly/brooklyn/2017/10/24/muira-mccammon-talks-gitmo-radical-networks/).
Finally, the records are not primarily in my own commercial interest. I seek the requested information for newsgathering purposes, and expect to incorporate it into journalistic work product to be disseminated to the public, like those already produced. See Muira Mccammon, Trouble @JTFGTMO, SLATE (April 17, 2018), https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/why-did-the-joint-task-force-of-guantanamo-start-deleting-tweets.html; Muira Mccammon, Can They Really Delete That?, SLATE (April 17, 2018), https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/why-did-the-joint-task-force-of-guantanamo-start-deleting-tweets.html.

For the reasons above, I respectfully request that the FBI grant a public interest fee waiver for this request, and that all fees related to the search, review, and duplication of the requested records be waived. If the fees will not be waived, I agree to pay up to $100 for the processing of this request. If the estimated fees will exceed this limit, please inform me before you begin processing.
Request for “News Media” Fee Status 
As a freelance journalist, I am a representative of the news media and do not seek the records requested for commercial use. Therefore, if the agency does not find that my request meets the standards required for a public interest fee waiver, I request that fees associated with the processing of my request be limited to reasonable duplication costs. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).

I am a representative of the news media because I “gather[] information of potential interest to a segment of the public, use[] [my] editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distribute[] that work to an audience.” Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). I can “demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication… by a… past publication record.” Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). 

My work has been featured in publications including Slate, VICE, the Massachusetts Review, Kill Screen, and more. I have previously requested documents obtained via FOIA from a range of federal agencies and government officials regarding the deletion of tweets from official Twitter accounts. I used that information to write a series of articles outlining both how individual agencies decided whether or not to delete tweets and more broadly how the government regards Twitter statements. These articles have been published, disseminated, and further reported upon to a broad audience. See Muira Mccammon, Trouble @JTFGTMO, SLATE (April 17, 2018), https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/why-did-the-joint-task-force-of-guantanamo-start-deleting-tweets.html; Muira Mccammon, Can They Really Delete That?, SLATE (April 17, 2018), https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/why-did-the-joint-task-force-of-guantanamo-start-deleting-tweets.html.. 
Therefore, if this request is not classified as being in the public interest, I respectfully request to be classified as a “news media” requester for purposes of fee assessments. 
***
I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format, if possible. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(B). I further request that you provide an estimated date on which you will finish processing this request. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B).
Thank you for your consideration of this request. As per 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i), I expect your determination on whether to comply with this request within twenty (20) days. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at the email address listed below.

Yours,

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.","1368159-000, DOJ-AP-2017-003598",False,1580,1491,FOIA the Trump Administration,,0.00,2017-02-17 05:00:00+00:00,,2017-05-17 00:00:00+00:00,donald-trump-302s-33527

If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established.

Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.""

This request seeks records regarding the acquisition, possession, and use of wi-fi interception devices.

Wi-fi interception devices intercept a wide-range of data from nearby smartphones, such as social media passwords, emails, Dropbox contents, the phone's previous locations, contact list, photos, internet browsing history, and technical details related to the phone itself, such as its MAC address, model, and operating system. A media report on these devices can be found here: https://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-boxes-that-can-steal-your-social-media-and-dropbox-passwords-for-the-cops

Another is “WINT,” made by Wintego: https://www.scribd.com/doc/291798739/1321-Wintego-Brochure

And a third is “Mabit,” an “app and cloud interception system,” from Israeli company Magen 100: http://i-hls.com/2015/02/israeli-system-intercepts-cloud-stored-data/

These companies market wi-fi interception devices to law enforcement, as well as other types of government agencies, and at least Magen 100's products has been approved for export.

Recommended places to deploy wi-fi interception devices include borders, busy city areas, and large public events, according to Magen 100's website: http://www.ma-gen.com/. Product brochures claim that the devices require minimal training to use, and leave no forensic traces on monitored smartphones.

My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.","NFP-68622, DOJ-AP-2017-003720",False,1578,1447,,,0.00,2017-02-19 05:00:00+00:00,,2017-06-30 00:00:00+00:00,fbi-email-failures-2016-33599

This letter is a formal { law name } request for the following records.

A. 

1. All FBI records concerning people who died more than 3 calendar years before this request.

Please search both your automated indices and the older general (manual) indices. Please also search the ELSUR electronic surveillance indices. Please also search the indices of all Field Offices.

As proof of death, and an enumeration of the deceased individuals whose records are requested, I direct you to the Social Security Administration's Open Access Death Master File, as defined in 15 CFR 1110.2. 

Please directly coordinate with SSA / NTIS to obtain the Open Access DMF, and conduct your search based on that database.


2. Social Security Death Index

At <https://www.fbi.gov/services/information-management/foipa/requesting-fbi-records>, you reference a ""Social Security Death Index page"". 

Please provide
 a) the entire Social Security Death Index (""SSDI""), and
 b) any FBI record defining the SSDI,
 c) any FBI record describing the SSDI or its usage, e.g. stating where it is to be obtained, how it is validated, why FBI FOIA uses it as a proof of death, SSDI-related policies, etc.

If you do not possess or control the SSDI, please refer this request to the Federal agency or agencies that do.

All content after this line is part of my standard template.

# Prioritization

Please prioritize, in order:
1. the items & subitems above, in the order listed
2. within each item or subitem, most recent records first.


# Additional requests

I also request:

B. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.

This part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).

C. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:
1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;
2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and
3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.

Parts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.

Parts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.


For all responsive records, I also request:

D.
1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered ""non-responsive"");
2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;
3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;
4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;
access to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and
5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.

Items in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.


# Timing

For all requests above, the ""cut-off date"" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.

The priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.


# FOIA IA notice

Please note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA § 6. 

In particular, please note that:
1. you must provide electronic format documents, §§ 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);
2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, § 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);
3. you may not withhold any record unless ""the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law"", § 552(a)(8)(A)(i);
4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, §§ 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and
5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, § 552(b)(5).


# ""Record"" defined

For the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, ""record"" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.


# Anti-duplication exclusion

This request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online ""reading room""), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).

This is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if ""available online""). 

This exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.

This request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.


# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records

Please forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.

This request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant any agreement with your agency.


# Minimal redaction

Please note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.


# Estimates and rolling updates

In order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.

Please provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.


# No new records; electronic & original format

This request does not ask you to create new records. 

If you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.

In particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.

However, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.

I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.

To the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request
1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and
2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.


# Rehab Act § 508 compliance

Please note that I am partially blind, use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack), and need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data).

In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act § 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible — for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).

This means, e.g.:
1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);
2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;
3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act § 508, 36 CFR 1194.22, USAB ATBCB-2015-0002, and I​SO 14289­-1;
4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;
5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address ""aliases"", full lists for ""distribution list"" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;
6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;
7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;
8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),
9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);
10. scans rather than paper copies;
11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;
12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);
13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;
14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. 


# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files

Multiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.

Do not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).

If there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.


# No physical ""duplication""; inspection & direct access

Please note that this request does not request that you physically ""duplicate"" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me — I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.

Furthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. 


# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver

I am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.

This request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.

1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.

This request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.

2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.

3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.

4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.

5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since
a. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;
b. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;
c. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;
d. they are not currently readily available; and
e. they are likely to be requested by others.

6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes ""duplication"" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the ""other non-commercial requester"" category.


# Requester

This request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).

Please note that “Sai” is my full legal name.


# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date

Upon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).


# Communication about this request and method for responding

If you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.

Please ensure that all of your responses comply with § 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR 1194.22, and UESB NPRM ATBCB-2015-0002.
In particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request — including notification and responsive records — by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. 

Do not respond using ZixCorp ""Secure Mail"" or any other method that ""expires"" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.


# ""Reasonable description"" and tailoring

Please note that a request need only be ""reasonably described"" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.

If you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. 

Please include in any response about ""reasonably described"", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.

Sincerely,
Sai
President, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.

Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.

If no search results are returned, I would like to receive a copy of something documenting that outcome instead.

(2) A copy of all manually kept index cards for the previous ELSUR Recordkeeping System, prior to 1991, that were not entered into the automated system (ERS Permanent) where the subject or location of surveillance includes the word ""Scientology.""  According to a publicly available REQUEST FOR RECORDS DISPOSITION form from 2010, the manually kept ERS index cards I am seeking are supposed to be maintained by the FBI and not transferred to the National Archives for 50 years after the date of the court order authorizing the collection or 50 years after closure of the related case file, whichever is later.

Please note, I am not requesting the actual ELSUR surveillance files related to the items requested above at this time. I am simply seeking a copy of the record summary information that is displayed on the automated ERS search results screen, and/or captured on the manually kept ERS index cards, for the criteria I specified. 

I also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest due to a recently self-published book by a former Church of Scientology member who refers to himself as ""Scientology's No. 1 spy"" during the largest infiltration of government agencies in 1970s known as Operation Snow White. This book, ""Arrows In The Dark"" by author Merrell Vannier, resurrects age-old conspiracy theories disseminated to the media and published independently by the Church of Scientology claiming they were the victims of widespread government infiltration, surveillance and unfair investigation. As such, the public's understanding of government operations will be served by revealing what, if any, surveillance events actually occurred so that these wild claims can be discredited as inaccurate once and for all.

""She had joined Project Raven, a clandestine team that included more than a dozen former U.S. intelligence operatives recruited to help the United Arab Emirates engage in surveillance of other governments, militants and human rights activists critical of the monarchy.

Stroud and her team, working from a converted mansion in Abu Dhabi known internally as “the Villa,” would use methods learned from a decade in the U.S intelligence community to help the UAE hack into the phones and computers of its enemies.

Stroud had been recruited by a Maryland cybersecurity contractor to help the Emiratis launch hacking operations, and for three years, she thrived in the job. But in 2016, the Emiratis moved Project Raven to a UAE cybersecurity firm named DarkMatter. Before long, Stroud and other Americans involved in the effort say they saw the mission cross a red line: targeting fellow Americans for surveillance.""

""Karma was used by an offensive cyber operations unit in Abu Dhabi comprised of Emirati security officials and former American intelligence operatives working as contractors for the UAE’s intelligence services. The existence of Karma and of the hacking unit, code named Project Raven, haven’t been previously reported. Raven’s activities are detailed in a separate story published by Reuters today.

The ex-Raven operatives described Karma as a tool that could remotely grant access to iPhones simply by uploading phone numbers or email accounts into an automated targeting system. The tool has limits  it doesn’t work on Android devices and doesn’t intercept phone calls.

For the purposes of this request, I am willing to exclude communications with the GAO that were sent to or from the director of either Agency. For this request, I am also happy to exclude materials simply relating to the facilitation of GAO audits of the Bureau.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.","1379804-000, DOJ-AP-2018-003454",False,1447,1003,The War on Oversight,,0.00,2017-06-30 04:00:00+00:00,2017-11-13,2018-09-17 15:14:45.992002+00:00,gao-fbi-file-39367

SHR was short-lived, as police arrested several of its members shortly after it incorporated. Although embittered by his experiences, Gerber maintained contacts within the fledgling homophile movement of the 1950s and continued to agitate for the rights of homosexuals. Gerber has been repeatedly recognized for his contributions to the LGBT movement. Note that proof of death is not required, as the date of birth is well over 100 years ago.

I would like to specify that the FBI should search all field offices as well as HQ for these records; to search the older, manual indices as well as the automated indices; and to include cross-references; as well as ELSUR (Electronic Surveillance). 

I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

According to the Dead List, he was a high ranking North Korean official who defected in 1997. Per FBI standards, this FBI file is acceptable proof of death.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.",1366646-000,False,1591,1176,Defiant Defectors and Rebellious Refugees,,0.00,2017-02-06 05:00:00+00:00,2017-03-07,2018-03-28 00:00:00+00:00,hwang-jang-yop-32972

EmmaBest,Keystone United,Rejected,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/keystone-united-31239/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning Keystone United, AKA Keystone State Skinheads (KSS). Keystone United, known until 2009 as the Keystone State Skinheads (KSS), is one of the largest and most active single-state racist skinhead crews in the country.

While its members attempt to project a mediagenic image of being part of a new breed of more sophisticated and less spasmodically violent skins, the truth is that the group’s members have been convicted of a string of remarkably violent attacks dating back to at least 1998, ranging from bar brawls to murder. Keystone United frequently sponsors white-power picnics and music festivals across Pennsylvania, including the annual ""hatecore"" event known as ""Uprise.""

The Keystone State Skinheads (KSS) formed near Harrisburg, Pa., in 2001. Like most racist skinhead outfits, the group says it is dedicated to white supremacy and cleaning up white society so that America will be more like ""many other once great European nations."" KSS says it is committed to ""being active in our communities, public awareness, contacting local politicians, or just simply showing people we are not ashamed of who we are."" Though the group holds picnics, hikes and other events it claims are ""family-friendly,"" it has a history of criminal violence. 

Membership quickly spread across the state, with associates in neighboring New Jersey and Maryland. In its early years, KSS was associated with the notoriously violent Hammerskin Nation — KSS helped organize the 2003 Hammerfest, a skinhead rock festival.

As KSS membership has flourished over the course of the crew's relatively brief history, the rap sheets of many of its prominent members have grown at a brisk pace as well. In June of 2002, three KSS members — Douglas Sonier, Joseph Hoesch and co-founder Robert Gaus — were arrested for assaulting a man who asked them to stop throwing food at his table at a diner in Feasterville, Pa., near Philadelphia. The three pleaded guilty to simple assault and were given suspended sentences.

In September that same year, three more KSS members — Todd Sager, Jason Hayden and Christopher Keough — attacked former KSS member Christopher Morosko after he refused to return his KSS colors. In March 2003, all three assailants pleaded guilty to assault and were sentenced to time served.

Also in March 2003, another three KSS members — Keith Carney, Steve Monteforte and Steven Smith — were arrested in Scranton for beating up Antoni Williams, a black man, using stones and chunks of pavement. Smith, a co-founder of the KSS, is a former Aryan Nations member and former leader of the Philadelphia chapter of National Association for the Advancement of White People, which was created by former Klan leader David Duke but is no longer associated with him. Smith was recruited into the neo-Nazi movement when he was a soldier at Fort Bragg, N.C. Carney is a former member of the neo-Nazi National Alliance who was arrested in December 2001 for placing National Alliance stickers on the Korean War and Vietnam Veterans memorials in Philadelphia. In the 2003 case, Smith and Monteforte pleaded guilty to terrorist threats and ethnic intimidation, with Monteforte getting a suspended sentence of a year's probation; Smith received a 60-day sentence and probation. Carney was charged with violating the terms of his probation from a previous criminal conviction and sentenced to a year in prison.

In April 2003, two KSS Lancaster chapter skinheads were charged with making terroristic threats and ethnic intimidation for racist and threatening comments directed at three black people in an area bar. The next documented violent incident involving KSS came in January 2006, when KSS Wilkes-Barre region leader Jason Honeywell was arrested for allegedly stabbing two anti-racist SHARP (Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice) skinheads outside an all-ages punk rock club. The stabbing occurred during a melée that erupted in the club and spread outside after KSS members made sieg-heil salutes and obscene gestures toward the black singer of the band River Side Riot, which was performing at the time. Both SHARPs — Timothy David Alonso and Sean Fitzmaurice — were severely injured. Honeywell was charged with four counts of aggravated assault.

Two weeks after the stabbings, the leader of the Pittsburgh and Greensburg chapters of the KSS, Todd Sager, was charged with criminal solicitation to commit homicide and criminal solicitation to commit aggravated assault. Sager was accused of ordering another KSS member, Edward Robert Locke, to stab a third KSS member during a brawl at a New Stanton sports bar. The fight erupted after the skinheads began allegedly harassing a mixed-race couple. Locke was charged with aggravated assault and attempted murder. The attempted murder charge was later dismissed.

In January 2007, KSS members Kenneth Hoover and Charles Marovskis were arrested for the 1998 murder of two homeless men in Tampa, Fla. At the time of the killing, the two were members of the Tampa division of Blood & Honour. The victims were attacked with a tire iron and an axe.

In 2009, KSS changed its name to Keystone United.

EmmaBest,Liberty Counsel,Rejected,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/liberty-counsel-31247/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning Liberty Counsel, a legal organization advocating for anti-LGBT discrimination under the guise of religious liberty. 

The Liberty Counsel was founded by conservative activists Mathew (“Mat”) Staver – an attorney and former dean at Liberty University School of Law – and his wife Anita. The Counsel bills itself as a non-profit litigation, education and policy organization that provides legal counsel and pro bono assistance in cases dealing with religious liberty, “the sanctity of human life"" and the family. Mat Staver chairs the Counsel; his wife Anita is the president. The Liberty Counsel shares a close affiliation with Liberty University (founded by the late Jerry Falwell in Lynchburg, Va.) , especially the university’s school of law. The partnership includes the Washington, D.C.-based Liberty Center for Law and Policy, which conducts legal research and writes about current legislation and policies.

Currently staffed by ten attorneys and some 300 volunteer attorneys nationwide, according to Mat Staver, the current director, the Counsel has garnered attention in recent years for its so-called “religious liberty” litigation, in which it defends Christians who it alleges are having their rights to religious expression trampled by secular society.

With the expansion of equal rights for LGBT people, especially, the Liberty Counsel has come into their own, working to attempt to ensure that Christians can continue to engage in anti-LGBT discrimination in places of business under the guise of “religious liberty.” Through lawsuits and its annual Awakening conference in Orlando, the Counsel attempts to enforce the idea that Christian beliefs and law trump all other law.

Staver has warned about homosexuality, abortion, and the consequences for Christians who oppose homosexuality and marriage equality, saying they will be targeted for their views. He even went so far as to call for a new revolutionary war as marriage equality advanced. In March of 2015, Staver stated that he would personally advocate disobedience to any U.S. Supreme Court ruling that favored marriage equality, and that “collectively, we cannot accept that as the rule of law.” During the 2015 brouhaha over Indiana’s religious freedom law, Staver likened “the homosexual lobby” to terrorists, claiming that “it’s hard to negotiated with people who are irrational and who are inventing things that simply don’t exist.”

He has also supported the criminalization of homosexuality both in the U.S. and in other countries, stating in one instance that Malawi’s anti-homosexuality laws were in its “own best interests” after the U.S. reportedly withheld monetary aid to the country because of its efforts to outlaw homosexuality. In the Counsel’s amicus curiae brief in the 2003 Lawrence v. Texas lawsuit in which the Supreme Court decriminalized sodomy, the attorneys writing (including Staver) called for the court to uphold anti-sodomy laws, stating that “This Court again should decline to deprive states of the power to enact statutes that proscribe harmful and immoral conduct.” The Liberty Counsel went on to say that statistical evidence “demonstrates, however, that those who engage in homosexual conduct are at increased risk for numerous diseases as compared to heterosexuals.”

The Liberty Counsel also garnered a reputation for strident pro-Christian rhetoric in its campaigns to ensure that “public displays of religion” are maintained during the Christmas holiday, but it has also adopted broader right-wing views, including the allegation that the Obama Administration has a “socialist liberal agenda.” The organization also has focused heavily on anti-gay activism and lawsuits to uphold so-called “ex-gay” therapy and to protect “religious liberty” of Christians.

Over the years, it has launched other attacks on what it perceives to be threats against Christmas and public morality. In 2000, for example, the Counsel threatened to file a lawsuit against the Jacksonville, Fla., library because staff was handing out certificates in honor of a Harry Potter book release. The certificates stated, “Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,” a hat-tip to the mythical and magical educational institute that Potter and friends attend in the globally popular series by author J.K. Rowling.

“Witchcraft is a religion,” Staver said, “and the certificate of witchcraft endorsed a particular religion in violation of the First Amendment establishment clause.” Staver’s reasoned that Wicca is considered a religion (the witchcraft practiced in the Harry Potter books is not Wicca and, in fact, is fictional).

In 2005, the Counsel, along with anti-LGBT hate group the American Family Association (AFA), fired off angry press releases regarding Ridgeway Elementary School in Ridgeway, Wis., for allegedly “changing the lyrics” of the Christmas song “Silent Night” for a school play. The Washington Post reported, however, the school didn’t change anything. Rather, the original play, called “The Little Christmas Tree,” features the original lyrics.

The Liberty Counsel has also been active in the battle against same-sex marriage and hate crimes legislation, which it claimed in a 2007 news release to be “'thought crimes' laws that violate the right to freedom of speech and of conscience"" and will ""have a chilling effect on people who have moral or religious objections to homosexual behavior."" In that same release, the Liberty Counsel falsely claimed that the brutal murder of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyo., had nothing to do with homosexuality, but instead was “a bungled robbery.”

In 2004, Staver published Same-Sex Marriage: Putting Every Household at Risk, an anti-LGBT screed about the perceived threat of homosexuality that includes numerous false claims about LGBT people, including that they’re promiscuous, that homosexuality is caused by a “longing to fill emotional deficits,” and that the goal of the “homosexual agenda” (an anti-LGBT conspiracy theory) is to move from simply being tolerated by heterosexuals to dominating them.

In his book, Staver cited the work of Paul Cameron, a discredited psychologist, and painted LGBT adults as a threat to children. “Homosexuality is a destructive lifestyle both physically and emotionally,” he wrote. “Same-sex marriage cannot be viewed in isolation from homosexual activity and its consequences on those who engage in such practices, and especially on children raised in such an environment.”

The book came one year after the Liberty Counsel launched its ""Change is Possible"" campaign with Parents and Friends of Ex-gays (PFOX), to protect ex-gays from ""discrimination"" at the hands of ""intolerant homosexuals,"" who are ""using our youth to advance an agenda"" as well as to promote so-called “ex-gay” therapy (also called “conversion” or “reparative” therapy). The Liberty Counsel said of the campaign that, ""given the health risks associated with homosexual behavior, our youth deserve to know that unwanted same-sex attractions can be overcome.”

Many of the established and reputable major American medical, psychological, psychiatric and counseling associations in the United States have rejected conversion therapy, and noted that homosexual orientation is normal and not a disorder and thus requires no attempts to change it. Nevertheless, the Liberty Counsel promotes conversion therapy and often files lawsuits against its bans so much that in 2013, Staver received the “Ex-Gay Freedom Award” from ex-gay organizations Voice of the Voiceless and Equality and Justice for All.

The Liberty Counsel has also provided a platform for other anti-gay activists, such as attorney and former boxer Matt Barber, who joined the Liberty Counsel in 2009 as Director of Cultural Affairs and then later served as the vice president of Liberty Counsel Action, the group’s lobbying arm. He is also Associate Dean for Online Programs at Liberty University School of Law. Though Barber no longer lists an affiliation with the Liberty Counsel in his biographical information, he still joins Staver frequently on the Counsel’s “Faith and Freedom” radio broadcast as a co-host.

Barber, who founded the virulently anti-LGBT site “Barbwire.com” in early 2014, which he edits, has spent years verbally bashing LGBT people, linking them to pedophilia, calling them dangers to children and at one point saying that gay partnerships involve  “one man violently cramming his penis into another man’s lower intestine and calling it ‘love.’” Barber later said those were not public comments, and instead something he had said in a private conversation with anti-LGBT activist Peter LaBarbera, who posted those comments on the Americans for Truth about Homosexuality website.

Liberty Counsel has had its share of controversies, but perhaps none of have been so prominent as its involvement in the ordeal of kidnapped child in 2009. Staver and another Liberty Counsel attorney, Rena Lindevaldsen, represented Lisa Miller.

Miller claimed to have “renounced homosexuality” and began a long custody battle with her partner, Janet Jenkins, over the child. Miller repeatedly denied court-ordered visitations under Liberty Counsel guidance and then fled the country with the couple’s child after legal custody of the child was granted to Jenkins.

Lindevaldsen would later write a book about Miller in which she claimed that people could leave homosexuality and that the “homosexual agenda” is dangerous. In 2012, Jenkins filed a RICO lawsuit against several parties that allegedly played a role in the kidnapping of her daughter. The lawsuit included Liberty School of Law, but it was dismissed from it in 2013 for lack of standing. Also named was Response Unlimited, a company run by Christian businessman Philip Zodhiates, an acquaintance of Staver’s. Zodhiates’s daughter was also named. She was working at Liberty Law School (of which Staver was dean at the time) and is alleged to have sent an email to co-workers at the law school requesting donations for supplies to send to Miller. Philip Zodhiates was indicted in 2014 for conspiracy in the Miller case.

Staver resigned from Liberty School of Law in the fall of 2014 (about two weeks after Zodhiates’ indictment), citing health concerns of his wife and the fact that he had seen the school through its accreditation process. In spite of that, he is busy with the Counsel, which continues to battle same-sex marriage around the country, linking it to the “downfall” of “religious liberty” for Christians.

The Liberty Counsel also signed on to defend longtime vitriolic anti-LGBT activist and crusader Scott Lively in 2012, who is being sued for human rights violations by an LGBT rights group in Uganda and the U.S.-based Center for Constitutional Rights. Lively played an instrumental part in the Ugandan parliament’s adoption of a draconian anti-LGBT bill that originally included the death penalty in some instances. The bill was amended to drop the death penalty and passed, but was annulled on a technicality in late 2014. The lawsuit is currently in the discovery phase, and a summary judgment briefing is slated for fall, 2015.

Most recently, Staver and the Counsel have taken a leading role in defending Rowan County, Ky., clerk Kim Davis who has refused to grant same-sex couples marriage licenses after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in June 2015. Davis claimed that her religion would not allow her to sign such licenses. Davis appealed the ruling with the Supreme Court, which refused to hear her case. She was then found in contempt of court for failing to uphold her duties as an elected official.

The Liberty Counsel has made her a cause célebrè for the anti-LGBT right, and aligned itself with the Family Research Council and Coach Dave Daubenmire’s Pass the Salt Ministry (Salt and Light Brigade) in rallies in Rowan County. Southern secessionist and former member of the white nationalist and neo-Confederate League of the South Michael Peroutka spoke at one such rally held in early September 2015 and the antigovernment Oath Keepers, who were present at the Bundy Ranch standoff, have claimed they’re going to “protect” Davis from another arrest (Davis’s legal team declined their “help.”). Not all are on board with the battle, however. A panel of legal experts on Fox News slammed Staver, and one called a statement he made questioning whether the Supreme Court has Constitutional authority “ridiculously stupid.”

For his part, Staver has compared Davis to a Jew living under Nazi Germany and complained that Christians are persecuted in America as court after court has ruled that she has to issue same-sex marriage licenses in accordance with her duties and the ruling of law. Staver has made that comparison in the past with regard to marriage equality, claiming that respecting gay marriage laws is no different than handing Jews over to Nazis.

My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, 214 and 266 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.",DOJ-AP-2017-003001,False,1636,1416,Haters: Documenting Extremist and Hate Groups,,0.00,2016-12-23 05:00:00+00:00,2017-01-25,2017-07-31 00:00:00+00:00,liberty-counsel-31247

I am collaborating with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a public interest group, and the media organization MuckRock, to survey how law enforcement agencies deploy mobile biometric technologies.

Mobile biometric technologies can be defined as any mobile device or mobile app used by law enforcement agencies to scan, capture, analyze, store, or automatically recognize any physical or biological characteristic of a subject. Commonly used mobile biometric technologies include fingerprint/thumbprint collection, facial recognition, scans of the iris or other elements of the human eye, Rapid DNA, and tattoo recognition. (Please see below for examples.)

Pursuant to Massachusetts Public Records Law, M.G.L. c.66, §10, I request the following records pertaining to mobile biometric technologies, including those listed above, as well as other biometric technologies I have not identified:

1) Purchasing and procurement documents, including but not limited to: purchase orders, RFPs, responses to RFPs, invoices and contracts

2) Policy, procedural, and training documents, including but not limited to: use policies, standard operating procedures, training materials, presentations, privacy assessments, data retention policies, and other guidelines

3) Programming documents, including but not limited to: funding opportunity announcements, grant applications and grantor status/progress reports, reports to legislative bodies, annual reports

4) Audit documents, including but not limited to: audits of the system, misuse reports, and reports to oversight bodies

In your response, I would appreciate that you individually address each of the above categories of documents individually.

In addition to the above classes of documents, I am also seeking the following information:

- The total number of individuals whose biometric data has been collected over the last three years, 
- The total number of [biometric data points] contained in the agency’s database
- The retention period for biometric data
- The number of mobile biometrics devices purchased and in use
- The total number of authorized users of the mobile biometrics devices 
- Which external agencies and entities have access to biometric data in the database and under what conditions, 
- Whether biometric data is combined with biographic data such as name and address in the database, and 
- The process by which data is entered into the database

These documents will be published online and inform the public dialog over police technology. Because of the great public interest in these issues, I ask that you waive any fees. If your agency is unable to do so, please contact me with an estimate of the costs.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Kenneth I MacPherson

EmmaBest,New Black Panther Party,Rejected,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/new-black-panther-party-31244/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning the New Black Panther Party, a racist and anti-Semitic organization whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law enforcement officers.

Founded in Dallas, the group today is especially active on the East Coast, from Boston to Jacksonville, Fla. The group portrays itself as a militant, modern-day expression of the black power movement (it frequently engages in armed protests of alleged police brutality and the like), but principals of the original Black Panther Party of the 1960s and 1970s— a militant, but non-racist, left-wing organization — have rejected the new Panthers as a ""black racist hate group"" and contested their hijacking of the Panther name and symbol.

The New Black Panther Party (NBPP) is a black separatist group that believes black Americans should have their own nation. In the NBPP's ""10 Point Platform,"" which is a takeoff on the 10-point platform of the original Black Panther Party, the NBPP demands that blacks be given a country or state of their own, within which they can make their own laws. They demand that all black prisoners in the United States be released to ""the lawful authorities of the Black Nation."" They claim to be entitled to reparations for slavery from the United States, all European countries and ""the Jews.""

The NBPP is notable for its anti-white and anti-Semitic hatred. Its leaders have blamed Jews for the 9/11 terrorist attacks and for the slave trade. The late former party chairman Khalid Abdul Muhammad has said, ""There are no good crackers, and if you find one, kill him before he changes."" A document on the NBPP website entitled ""The Nationalist Manifesto"" claims that white men have a secret plan to commit genocide against the non-white races. It also refers to black people who condone mixed-race relationships as the ""modern day Custodians [sic] of Uncle Tom's Cabin.""

NBPP members also hold black-supremacist religious beliefs. Some think that blacks are God's true ""chosen people"" and that the people normally called ""Jews"" actually are impostors (this ideology is remarkably similar to the white racist theology of Christian Identity, which says whites are God's real chosen people). They believe that blacks are naturally superior to people of other races. In September 1997, Khalid Muhammad said that he could not be anti-Semitic because Jews had no claim to the term ""Semite.""

Members of the original Black Panther Party, which has no connection to the NBPP, have heavily criticized the New Black Panther Party. An open letter from the Dr. Huey P. Newton Foundation, which is run by members of the original Black Panther Party, decries the NBPP for being a hateful and unconstructive group. Bobby Seale, a famous founding member of the original Panthers, calls the organization ""a black racist hate group.""

By injecting themselves into racially charged and other high-profile events, the NBPP has won considerable press attention. When members march, they often wear coordinated, military-style uniforms — black boots, black pants, a black shirt with NBPP patches on it, and black berets.

The NBPP claims to have been founded in 1989, although the group was not active until 1990. That year, Aaron Michaels, a Dallas radio personality, assembled a group of black citizens to engage in community activism. He called the group the New Black Panther Party. One of its main goals was to increase black representation on the Dallas school board. The group also attempted to reduce drug dealing in certain black neighborhoods. In 1993, the group organized an event called the National Black Power Summit and Youth Rally, which had around 200 attendees. White supremacist Tom Metzger spoke at the event as a special guest. Although Metzger is no friend of blacks, both he and NBPP members believe that whites and blacks should live in their own separate countries. At that 1993 meeting, Michaels made the likely exaggerated claim that the NBPP had formed 20 chapters.

In 1994, Khalid Abdul Muhammad became actively involved with the NBPP. Muhammad was formerly the personal assistant to Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has listed as a black hate group since 1998. In November 1993, while still associated with the Nation of Islam, he gave a notorious speech at Kean College in New Jersey. He accused Jews of being responsible for the slave trade, called Jews ""bloodsuckers,"" and asserted that white South Africans should be killed if they refuse to leave South Africa. The speech caused a controversy, leading Farrakhan to demote Muhammad from his position as national spokesman in February 1994. In May 1994, Muhammad was shot and injured by James Bess, a former Nation of Islam member. 

A Dallas school board meeting was canceled in May 1996 after the Panthers threatened to come with loaded weapons. NBPP founder Aaron Michaels and Khalid Muhammad worked together closely during this time, appearing together at a press conference regarding the school board incident.

In 1997, Fahim Minkah and Marvin Crenshaw, two original Panthers from Dallas, won an injunction against Aaron Michaels disallowing him from using either the old Panther name or its logo. The injunction was never enforced and the NBPP continued to use the Panther name and the Panther logo to this day.

On June 7, 1998, James Byrd, Jr., was murdered in Jasper, Texas, by three white men who chained the black man to the back of a truck and dragged him to death. In the wake of the horrific murder, Khalid Muhammad led a group of armed NBPP members to Jasper where members confronted a group of Klansmen who rallied in the town. About 50 Panthers, a dozen of whom carried rifles and shotguns, faced off against about 20 Klan members. Police officers erected a barricade to separate the two groups. NBPP members twice tried to break through and confront the KKK protesters, but failed to do so. Frustrated, Muhammad called for his followers to attack the police, shouting: ""Black people, we can take these bastards. We can run over the damn police and take their ass. Who's with me?"" Police officers attempted to evacuate the Klan members, but a small group of Panthers surrounded one of their vehicles and started rocking it back and forth. As a result, one NBPP member was arrested. No further violence occurred.

In September 1998, Khalid Muhammad organized the Million Youth March in New York City. Then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani attempted to prevent the group from holding the event, denying them a permit and referring to the rally as a ""hate march."" But the NBPP won a court battle, forcing the city to allow the event. Malik Zulu Shabazz, the future leader of party, played a prominent role in organizing the event. On Sept. 5, about 6,000 people attended the march while 3,000 police officers oversaw the event. A few minutes after the rally was scheduled to end, police began to disperse the crowd, resulting in a scuffle that left 16 police officers and 12 attendees injured. Muhammad reportedly encouraged the crowd to attack police officers with chairs and bottles and even to take the officers' guns if attacked. Shortly after this event, Muhammad became the national chairman of the NBPP, making him the leader of the organization.

Muhammad served as chairman until Feb. 17, 2001, when he died of a brain aneurysm. That year, Malik Zulu Shabazz, a Washington, D.C., attorney who had run unsuccessfully for the City Council in 1995, took over leadership of the group. He co-sponsored an Oct. 31, 2001 conference in which he and a handful of Muslim clerics blamed the Jews for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Said Shabazz: ""Zionism is racism, Zionism is terrorism, Zionism is colonialism, Zionism is imperialism, and support for Zionism is the root of why so many were killed on September 11."" He also referred to Israel and the United States as ""terrorists."" Shabazz would later claim that Jews had received advance warning of the attacks, a false conspiracy theory that is also highly popular in white supremacist and neo-Nazi circles.

Shabazz worked to improve relations between the NBPP and the Nation of Islam, where many NBPP members had their roots, including former leader Khalid Muhammad. In 2005, Louis Farrakhan invited Shabazz to be the co-convener of the 10th anniversary of the Million Man March. The groups also appeared together at events calling for reparations for black slavery. (That friendly relationship has continued. As late as January 2010, Shabazz was expressing his approval of the Nation of Islam and reiterating his commitment to support its efforts.)

In May 2006, Shabazz led a group of New Black Panthers in a protest on Duke University's campus in North Carolina. A few months earlier, members of Duke's lacrosse team had been accused of raping a black exotic dancer who they had hired to work a private party — charges that were ultimately shown to be false. The NBPP demanded that the accused players be found guilty and that all the students who were at the party be expelled. Several of the NBPP members came to the protest armed. Two brought knives, some wore bulletproof vests, and one brought a gun, which a police officer insisted that he leave in his car.

In August 2006, several members of the NBPP served as security personnel for former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney's primary campaign, which she lost. After McKinney lost the primary, a journalist asked her what she attributed her loss to. Hashim Nzinga, the NBPP National Chief of Staff, interrupted: ""Why do you think she lost? You wanna know what led to the loss? Israel. The Zionists. You. Put on your yarmulke and celebrate."" (The former Georgia Democrat and the NBPP's connection continues today. In May 2010, McKinney spoke at the NBPP Black Power Convention.)

In September 2007, three white men and three white women in West Virginia were arrested for kidnapping, torturing, and sexually assaulting Megan Williams, a 20-year-old mentally disabled black woman. In October 2007, Shabazz seized on Williams' case, demanding that all six of the defendants be charged with hate crimes — this despite Williams' previous romantic involvement with one of her assailants, which prosecutors said underlined how the crimes were not legally hate crimes. But Shabazz ignored the prosecutors, reaching out to Megan's mother, Carmen Williams, and giving her legal advice and supposedly working to raise money for her daughter. 

On Nov. 3, 2007, Shabazz held a rally in front of the federal courthouse in Charleston, W.Va., where he demanded that all the defendants be charged with hate crimes. The rally drew about 1,000 people. The NAACP refused to endorse the event, presumably because of Shabazz and the NBPP's racist views. But Shabazz was supported by the Rev. Al Sharpton, who reportedly attended and later had Shabazz on his radio program, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which also reportedly endorsed the rally. After the event, Shabazz announced that he had collected at least $5,000 on Williams' behalf, and pledged to continue to raise money. Two weeks later, Logan County prosecutor Brian Abraham petitioned the court to appoint a legal guardian for Williams. He was worried that Williams' mother and Shabazz were not acting in Megan's best interests, and that the publicity was not good for Megan or her case. Shabazz challenged the guardian petition and it was denied. But many of those close to the case remained concerned about Shabazz's advocacy. In October 2009, Megan's attorney, Byron Potts, said, ""I know for a fact she [Megan] has been manipulated. … People raised money for her, she never received that money.""

On Nov. 4, 2008, two NBPP members showed up, wearing military-style fatigues and berets, at a Philadelphia polling station, supposedly to protect black voters from having their rights violated. King Samir Shabazz, the local NBPP chapter leader, brandished a nightstick and made threatening remarks to voters (much of this was captured on a videotape reportedly made by GOP poll watchers). An eyewitness claimed that Samir Shabazz said, ""Cracker, you are about to be ruled by a black man."" Jerry Jackson, a certified Democratic poll watcher who also wore NBPP garb, accompanied him. Police officers arrived at the scene and forced Samir Shabazz to leave, though they allowed Jackson to stay. After the incident, the NBPP distanced itself from Samir Shabazz's actions and suspended the Philadelphia chapter.

The Justice Department filed civil charges of voter intimidation in January 2009 under the Voting Rights Act (the Bush Administration, which filed the charges in its last hours, chose not to pursue a criminal case) against King Samir Shabazz, Jerry Jackson, the New Black Panther Party and Malik Zulu Shabazz. They won the case by default in April 2009 when the defendants did not appear in court. But DOJ officials under the Obama Administration decided to drop most of the charges, saying the evidence did not substantiate the allegations that votes were suppressed or that the party or its leader were culpable. They did, however, get an injunction against Samir Shabazz that forbade him to bring a weapon to any Philadelphia polling place until 2012. 

In January 2010, Samir Shabazz was reinstalled as head of the newly reactivated Philadelphia chapter. On April 23, 2010, he wrote in a reference to the prosecutors who investigated the case against him, ""You are nothing more than a modern day lynch mob."" In May 2010, Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez defended the Department of Justice's decision to drop the charges. He cited local officers' decision to allow Jackson to remain when they removed Samir Shabazz (suggesting that Jackson was not intimidating voters) and the fact that there were no similar incidents at other polling stations. These facts, Perez argued, exonerated Jackson, Malik Shabazz, and the NBPP from charges of voter intimidation. Nevertheless, a wide array of right-wing and conservative individuals and groups attacked the DOJ's decision as supposedly revealing the Obama Administration's refusal to pursue cases against black racists.

The group made headlines across the country in March 2012 when Mikhail Muhammad, a New Black Panther leader in  Florida, said the NBPP was placing a $10,000 “bounty” on a neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, an African American, in Sanford, Fla. When asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad said, “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.” The group also called for the mobilization of 10,000 black men to capture the Hispanic man who shot the unarmed teen as he was walking through a gated community wearing a hooded sweatshirt and carrying only some candy and iced tea. The lack of charges against the gunman, who claimed he was attacked by Martin, sparked nationwide outrage.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.",1380376-000,False,1434,71,,,0.00,2017-07-13 04:00:00+00:00,2017-08-10,2021-04-06 04:56:00+00:00,peter-w-smith-39988

Keith Raniere, et al.",Rejected,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/records-of-property-forfeited-through-us-v-keith-raniere-et-al-86357/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"All Bureau records related to any and all assets searched, seized, condemned and/or forfeited as part of Court Case Number CR-18-0204, U.S. v. Keith Raniere, et al. This request is specific to intellectual and real property that has been seized and is now acknowledged as government property, and is no longer personal property of the defendants. 

The Overwhelming Public Interest in These Records:

The case of U.S. v. Keith Raniere, et al. centers upon an international-scale corporate entity under the umbrella of Executive Success Programs, dba. NXIVM, that encompassed several sub-groups both acknowledged and secret. The public interest in the group is demonstrable, as the entity and its members have been known to the public for almost two decades. It has wielded influence among several sets of public persons (including politicians, celebrities and the wealthy). Its curious practices have often invited public scrutiny, as they are described as ""cult-like."" The group has been discussed extensively in media (including in broadcasts, print and internet media including the CBC, 20/20, Forbes, Vanity Fair and Buzzfeed News). 

The overwhelming public interest in disclosure of material is enough to overcome any exemptions to FOIA. While the defendants in U.S. v. Keith Raniere, et al. have yet to be sentenced, they have all either pleaded guilty or have been found guilty and all forfeiture claims have been ruled upon; as such, there is no harm to an ongoing adjudication. Seizure and forfeiture are routine operations of government, and not covered by the investigative methods exemption.

Documents attesting to the government's uncontested ownership of the real property and intellectual property are available as entries to the docket in the case, and they are attached:
* Case 1:18-cr-00204-NGG-VMS Document 796: Notice of Forfeiture 
* Case 1:18-cr-00204-NGG-VMS Document 823: Stipulation between USAO and Nancy Bronfman, relinquishing third-party Sara Bronfman's claims to the New Karner Road properties
* Case 1:18-cr-00204-NGG-VMS Document 840: Order (by Nicholas G. Garaufis, US District Judge) dismissing Keith Raniere's claim of any ownership to First Principles Inc. 

Public Interest viz. Real Property Records:

As indicated in these documents, premises known to have been searched, seized and had their accompanying assets forfeited to the government include the following addresses:  3 Oregon Trail, Waterford, New York; 8 Hale Drive, Halfmoon, New York 12065; 7 Generals Way, Clifton Park, New York 12065; 447, 455, 457 New Karner Road, Albany, New York 12205. Please include all documentation of search and seizure (e.g., warrants, reports of searches, and inventory information). This should include any document describing the respective buildings, appurtenances, improvements, fixtures, attachments, easements and furnishings (for example, photographs and property records).

There is a clear public interest in the Bureau's records regarding these properties, including how they were used as part of a criminal conspiracy. Several accounts from the U.S. v. Raniere, et al. trial describe specific fixtures and furnishings that were part of the criminal acts, e.g., the installation of equipment for the confinement and surveillance of at least one person as a prisoner.   

Public Interest viz. Intellectual Property of First Principles:

In addition, records state that the government has seized ""All right, title and interest in First Principles Inc., a Delaware corporation, and all assets' rights thereof, including but not limited to bank accounts and intellectual property rights (19-FBI-005572).""  This was the sole property that had its forfeiture contested, by self-proclaimed ""innocent party"" Keith Raniere. As noted above, this claim has been dismissed by Judge Garaufis.

Upon information and belief, ""intellectual property rights of First Principles Inc."" includes rights to the underlying documents (including textual records as well as audio or visual recordings) asserted to have been held under patent or copyright by this company. Thus, in addition to any inventory produced by the Bureau regarding the holdings of First Principles, this request specifies that actual documents produced under the First Principles copyright to be released in appropriate formats for viewing by the public. 

An example of such a  document is described as a ""manual"" for Executive Success Program (""[a] 265-page manual  [that]contains a copyright notice on virtually every page,"") as well as documents described as course ""modules"" for Executive Success Program (see: ""NXIVM CORPORATION v. Ross Institute, Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit 2004,"" Opinion by John M. Walker, Jr., Chief Judge.). 

Further, an article about the U.S. v. Raniere, et al. trial indicates that a box of documents was seized at the Oregon Trail, Waterford residence included ""purported financial records of 'enemies of NXIVM' such as federal judges, journalists and [a] political consultant."" (see: Gavin. Albany TImes-Union. ""NXIVM's files on 'enemies' debated in court."" published May 14, 2019). It is my assumption that the government takes the view that such documents were commissioned by First Principles, as part of their copyright defense strategy, and should be considered their former intellectual property now in possession of the government.

I reiterate that there is an overwhelming public interest in the disclosure of this material and that there is no harm to ongoing matter. To attest to the public interest in the portfolio of intellectual property, the content of First Principles materials have been previously critiqued and examined by psychologists interested in their use for coercive control over individuals (see: John Hochman, M.D., ""A Forensic Psychiatrist Evaluates ESP"" February 2003). As the government is now in full possession of the copyright and patent portfolio, it should disclose all such materials for similar public examination. The release of the full portfolio of intellectual property will allow for further examination of how Executive Success Program dba. NXIVM worked, the degree to which it was either scientific or flim-flam, and has potentially invaluable use in the examination of similar groups.

A Plea for Fulfillment of the FOIA Request:

I plea for both a fulsome and speedy return of materials. I have included descriptions and listings for example purposes; they are not meant as a limitation. Please be consistent with the first paragraph's request for *all* records of search, seizure, condemnation and forfeiture of intellectual and real property the above-captioned case. Please note, that if there is other property not named but described, it should be considered responsive. As has been handed down by the courts, ""FOIA requests are not a game of Battleship. The requester should not have to score a direct hit on the records sought based on the precise phrasing of his request."" (see: ""GOV'T ACCOUNTAB. PROJ. v. US DEP'T OF HOMELAND, 335 F.

A disposition defaulting to release of relevant records is appropriate this request given public interest in open source privacy development. lease see the January 2016 court ruling rejecting in clear terms a refusal to provide processing notes for FOIA requests. These are legitimate records routinely produced without the sensitivities carved out by explicit FOIA exemption.

'''
The FBI improperly withheld all records that would show how it responds to Freedom of Information Act requests, a federal judge ruled...

Summarizing the case at issue as one ""about how the FBI applies FOIA to FOIA,"" U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss said the exemption the FBI invoked here covers records compiled for law-enforcement purposes.

It said records related to past FOIA cases would risk ""the implicit disclosure of highly sensitive information relating to ongoing investigations, confidential informants and classified national security matters,"" as paraphrased Friday by Judge Moss.

The FBI also invoked an invasion-of-privacy exception it said covers records tracking the performance of FBI personnel.

A court battle over the requests has been brewing for over three years, and Judge Moss granted each side partial summary judgment last week in a 63-page decision.

In rejecting the government's reliance on the ""possible presence"" of harm, Moss pointed to recent Supreme Court precedent warning ""against permitting even substantial policy considerations to trump the plain language of the FOIA.""

""There may be compelling reasons to authorize the FBI to withhold search slips and similar processing records,"" Moss wrote. ""But the FOIA itself does not do so, and the FBI cannot act on the basis of an exemption ... that Congress has not provided.""

EmmaBest,The Creativity Movement,Rejected,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/the-creativity-movement-31225/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"Records relating to or mentioning the Creativity Movement. The Creativity Movement is the latest of several incarnations of the racist group (and religion) originally known as Church of the Creator. The movement promotes what it sees as the inherent superiority and “creativity” of the white race.

Founded in 1973 by Ben Klassen, a one-time Florida state legislator and the inventor of the electric can opener, the movement promotes what it sees as the inherent superiority and “creativity” of the white race — about the only tenets there are (aside from an obsession with healthy foods) to its supposed “theology.”

The Creativity Movement rose from the ashes of the World Church of the Creator (WCOTC), a post-Klassen version of Church of the Creator, after WCOTC’s leader was sent to prison to serve a 40-year sentence in 2003. The logo of the group, which is concentrated in Montana, is the letter “W,” standing for the white race, topped by a crown and a halo. The crown symbolizes the claim that so-called Creators are the elite, and the halo is meant to signify that adherents “believe that our white genes are our greatest treasure and [that] we should safeguard our gene pool zealously.”

The Creativity Movement is the latest incarnation of the Church of the Creator, which was established by Ben Klassen in 1973. Its adherents believe that race, not religion, is the embodiment of absolute truth and that the white race is the highest expression of culture and civilization. Jews and non-whites —  “mud races” — are believed to be intent on subjugating whites. By the late 1980s, increasing numbers of white supremacists were drawn to Klassen’s Nazi-like belief system, which he spelled out in a series of books, most importantly The White Man’s Bible.

 Over the years, some so-called Creators have acted on their group’s calls for RaHoWa — “racial holy war” — and been arrested and imprisoned for violent, race-based crimes. In 1992, for example, George Loeb, a Church of the Creator “reverend,” was convicted of first-degree murder in the slaying a year earlier of Harold Mansfield, Jr., an African-American Gulf War veteran, in a parking lot in Neptune Beach, Fla. Loeb was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole.

After Klassen committed suicide in 1993, the Church of the Creator teetered on the brink of extinction. But in 1995, Matt Hale of East Peoria, Ill., resurrected the group, changing its name to World Church of the Creator (WCOTC) in the process and giving himself the title of Pontifex Maximus, meaning “high priest.” Composed largely of racist skinheads, the Hale-led group grew from 14 chapters in 1996 to 88 by 2002, making it the neo-Nazi group with the largest number of chapters in America at that time. In 1999, the group came into the national spotlight after a key member, Benjamin Smith, went on a three-day rampage, apparently enraged that Hale had been denied his law license on moral grounds despite passing the bar exam. Smith killed an African American and a Korean American and wounded nine others. Hale initially denied knowing Smith, but he was lying. As it turned out, Hale had just months earlier named Smith the “Creator of the Year,” the group’s top honor, and, moreover, had spent many hours on the phone with him immediately before the rampage. Although Hale was never charged in connection with Smith’s murder spree (Smith killed himself as police closed in), many officials felt that he had been involved but evaded responsibility.

But Hale did finally get in serious trouble, being arrested in January 2003 during a federal court battle over the name of his group. A non-racist church in the Pacific Northwest had sued WCOTC, saying it had trademarked the name and demanding that the neo-Nazi group stop using it. Eventually, the judge hearing the copyright case ruled in the non-racist church’s behalf, which apparently infuriated Hale enough to suggest to the group’s security chief (who turned out to be a federal informant) that he murder the judge. The following year, Hale was convicted of one count of solicitation of murder and three counts of obstruction of justice and received a 40-year federal prison sentence. Once again, the church almost collapsed. What loyalists remained became the Creativity Movement (this name change was forced, of course, by the outcome of the federal trademark trial).

After Hale went to prison, the Creativity Movement was plagued by schisms and a lack of centralized leadership. A Florida leader, Adam Jacobs, appeared to take the reins as acting national boss in 2004. But the following year, Jacobs was charged with viciously beating a fellow Creator over a period of 11 hours because he suspected the other man was a snitch. One more time, the Creativity Movement nearly disappeared.

Despite this rocky start, the Creativity Movement eventually saw modest but surprising growth. The Montana Creativity Movement began doing literature drops around Montana and staged rallies in Kalispell and Bozeman in the fall of 2009. This helped the organization to reach 14 chapters in 2009, an increase of three from 2008. Eight of those chapters were in Montana, but as of 2010, the group was led by James Logsdon of Zion, Ill.

The Creativity Movement generated news in 2009 and 2010 when a Billings member, Allen Michael Goff, was charged with felony assault with a weapon and a misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon after he allegedly shot a Hispanic teen in the leg after a party. Although Goff was 17 at the time, he was charged as an adult by prosecutors who said the shooting was racially motivated. They tried to introduce at trial evidence of Goff’s affiliation with the Creativity Movement, but the judge denied their request, saying the evidence didn’t show that the shooting was racially motivated.

Goff — who was named “Creator of the Year” in a Creativity Movement Internet forum in 2009 — pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge, and a jury acquitted him of the felony charge in May 2010. The following month, Goff was sentenced to six months of probation and fined $150. Two days later, he confronted Travis McAdam, executive director of the Montana Human Rights Network, who was presiding over an exhibit featuring the literature and beliefs of the Creativity Movement. Goff accused McAdam of ruining his life. “We’ve always felt he was one of the ringleaders,” McAdam told the Southern Poverty Law Center. “I think what that encounter showed everyone is that he’s going to feel more emboldened now.”

 In January 2007, a spin-off calling itself the Creativity Alliance was formed. It’s composed of individuals from Klassen and Hale’s former groups as well as new members, but has no affiliation with the Creativity Movement. Like the Creativity Movement, the Creativity Alliance views Klassen as its founder. In many other ways, however, it differs from the Creativity Movement. It has a more informal organizational structure than the older organization, with individual members expected to find at least one receptive white person to join them in the formation of a local chapter.

The Creativity Alliance claims to eschew a future racial holy war and it has a policy of “non-participation in the ‘White Power’ social scene.” It is hardly a benign organization, however. One of the articles featured on its website is a screed from 2008 by “Brother A.V.W.” In it, the author repeatedly makes slurs against “niggers” and “the hideous Jews.” He ends the piece, “White man fight! White man fight! White man fight!”

Trump Jr., as confirmed to exist by Julian Assange himself. As both are public figures and there is an overriding public interest due to the President's son being in contact with the head of what CIA has labelled a ""hostile intelligence service."" This is especially true since, according to Julian Assange, he attempted to solicit materials from the President's son and he communicated with him on the matter they are alleged, by some, to have colluded on. This material will be disseminated to MuckRock's thousands of readers and beyond, which clearly serves a public interest well beyond my own.

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).

As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.""

Proof of death: This individual is listed as dead in the FBI's Dead List, which also confirms the existence of the file. Per FBI standards and regulations, an FBI file is acceptable proof of death. For your convenience, a copy of the list may be found at https://archive.org/details/FBIRIDsDeadList2015

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.",1368062-000,False,1575,1399,,,0.00,2017-02-22 05:00:00+00:00,2017-06-22,2017-08-17 00:00:00+00:00,yury-shutov-33819
