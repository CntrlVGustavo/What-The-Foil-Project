EmmaBest,Sextortion Email Campaigns (Federal Bureau of Investigation),Awaiting Acknowledgement,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/sextortion-email-campaigns-federal-bureau-of-investigation-91994/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,2020-05-15,,"Documents, emails, memos, reports and other records mentioning or describing ""sextortion emails"" or CYIM 20-008, entitled ""Sextortion Email Campaign.""

According to CYIM 20-008, ""This well-known scam addresses the targeted person by name and references one of their passwords, often in the subject line, to catch their  attention. The email then claims to have hacked their computer and filmed them watching pornography.  The malicious actor threatens to send the videos to all of the victimâ€™s contacts unless they pay a bitcoin ransom. The passwords used in these scams are obtained from large data breaches that were leaked onto the web.""

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.

As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.",,False,423,423,,"bitcoin,data breach,extortion,hack,ransom,sextortion",0.00,2020-04-19 14:49:41.633968+00:00,2020-05-15,,sextortion-email-campaigns-federal-bureau-of-investigation-91994
