Proof of death is not required as his death has been widely and extensively reported by the media and is known to the FBI. 

Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, ""a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.",1367577-000,False,1583,1562,Defiant Defectors and Rebellious Refugees,,0.00,2017-02-14 05:00:00+00:00,,,bezmenov-33306

EmmaBest,FBI: Serial Filer List,Withdrawn,https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/fbi-serial-filer-list-50108/,United States of America,10,Federal,United States of America,Federal Bureau of Investigation,10,,,"To Whom It May Concern:

This is a request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. 

I hereby request records pertaining to any vexsome filter list, vexatious filer list, serial filer list,  nuisance filer list, or any other list or compilation (and drafts and derivations thereof) that lists FOIA requesters based on the quantity or type of FOIA requests they have submitted, or their behavior relating to FIOA requests.

Additionally, I request any and all records that describe how names or organizations have been, are, or could be added or removed from that list, or how being on such a list impacts the processing or charging of fees for the individuals or organizations on the list(s)

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that “proof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that ""qualified because it also had “firm” plans to “publish a number of . . . ‘document sets’” concerning United States foreign and national security policy."" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information."" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.

The requested documents will be published and made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. The requested records will be used for non-commercial research and journalism purposes, and will significantly contribute to an understanding of government activities by the general public.

Please ensure that any and all systems, databases, stores, and drives are searched for responsive data.

In the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD/DVD if not.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.

RE:  FOIPA # 148602-000		
REQUESTING:  My case # regarding corruption and ALL FBI  records ( documentation) obtained by your agency regarding influence and racketeering and pension fraud by way of fraudulent retire/rehire practices at the City of Elizabethtown, KY Municipality.
I am including the following information:
Mine and my husband’s 3 different visits to the FBI Louisville Field Office:
VISIT # 1:  In November 2014 and was terminated in Jan 2015 where I was a 20+ year employee.  
VISIT # 2: The Duty Agent did not want to take my evidence of influence and racketeering and fraudulent retire/rehire practices.  I had to insist she take my evidence.  
VISIT # 3:  A duty agent told me not to step foot on FBI property again.  I reminded the agent that taxpayer funds pay for that building.  My husband and I then left the premises.  

Excerpts of KY STATUTE KRS61.637 which pertain to evidence your agency was given from myself:
(10) If a member is receiving a retirement allowance or has filed the forms required for a retirement allowance and is employed within one (1) month of the member's initial retirement date in a position that is required to participate in the same retirement system from which the member retired, the member's retirement shall be voided and the member shall repay to the retirement system all benefits received. The member shall contribute to the member account established for him or her prior to his or her voided retirement. The retirement allowance for which the member shall be eligible upon retirement shall be determined by total service and creditable compensation. 
(13) If the retirement system determines that the retired member has been employed in a position with the same principal duties as the position from which the member retired: 
(a) The member's retirement allowance shall be suspended during the period that begins on the month in which the member is reemployed and ends six (6) months after the member's termination;
(b) The retired member shall repay to the retirement system all benefits paid from systems administered by Kentucky Retirement Systems under reciprocity, including medical insurance benefits, that the member received after reemployment began;
(c) Upon termination, or subsequent to expiration of the six (6) month period from the date of termination, the retired member's retirement allowance based on his or her initial retirement account shall no longer be suspended and the member shall receive the amount to which he or she is entitled, including an increase as provided by KRS 61.691; (d) Except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, if the position in which a retired member is employed after initial retirement is a regular full-time position, the retired member shall contribute to a second member account established for him or her in the retirement system. Service credit gained after the member's date of reemployment shall be credited to the second member account; and (e) Upon termination, the retired member shall be entitled to benefits payable from his or her second retirement account. 
(15) (a) If a retired member is reemployed at least one (1) month after initial retirement in a different position, or at least six (6) months after initial retirement in the same position, and prior to normal retirement age, the retired member shall contribute to a second member account in the retirement system and continue to receive a retirement allowance from the first member account. 
(17) Notwithstanding any provision of subsections (1) to (7)(a) and (10) to (15) of this section, the following shall apply to retired members who are reemployed by an agency participating in one (1) of the systems administered by Kentucky Retirement Systems on or after September 1, 2008:
 (a) Except as provided by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this subsection, if a member is receiving a retirement allowance from one (1) of the systems administered by Kentucky Retirement Systems, or has filed the forms required to receive a retirement allowance from one (1) of the systems administered by Kentucky Retirement Systems, and is employed in a regular full-time position required to participate in one (1) of the systems administered by Kentucky Retirement Systems or is employed in a position that is not considered regular full-time with an agency participating in one (1) of the systems administered by Kentucky Retirement Systems within three (3) months following the member's initial retirement date, the member's retirement shall be voided, and the member shall repay to the retirement system all benefits received, including any health insurance benefits. 
NOTE:  The statute could have been altered, SEVERAL YEARS have gone by since I ousted the fraudulent retire/rehire practices and my memory is not what it once was and I am aware documents have either been removed or altered.
The following information is pertinent to the case:
* On May 2, 2020 I asked for my case # from the FBI through an email at the IC3 website.    I did receive a response stating they would get back to me in a # of days (I do not recall how long).  Shortly thereafter that email disappeared from my email account.  
*On October 19, 2020 I asked for my CASE # again thru a FOIA request (via Fax and certified letters) to Special Agent, Brian Jones, in charge of the FBI Louisville Field Office, with copies going to my KY DC Representative Brett Guthrie, Senator Rand Paul and Senator Mitch McConnell.   
*On October 22, 2020 Senator Paul responded and asked me to sign a privacy release form, which I did.  He stated he would contact the appropriate agency for me.
*On DECEMBER 3rd, 2020, I received a letter stating I could possibly be charged for search and duplication fees in accordance with 5USC SS 552 (a)(4)(A)(ii)(III).  That email has since DISAPPEARED from my email account and I do not recall who it was from, it was either OGIS or the FBI.
*On February 10, 2021 I received a letter from OGIS stating I should try to contact the FBI directly, (which I have on several occasions).  I was also given an email address to check the status online.  Once I typed in my FOIPA # I received the following message – the FOIPA number was closed.  I also received another message stating FOIA # was closed and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.
NOTE:  I did receive several other emails and letters from the FBI, they have since disappeared from my computer and out of my home.

I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers.

In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience.

Additionally, courts have held that the news media status ""focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be “made by” a representative of the news media. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).

Shapoor Reporter was born in Tehran in 1920. His father was Indian Parsi, Ardeshir Reporter, was also a prominent British intelligence officer who came from Mumbai to Tehran in 1893 as the agent of Parsis. He developed friendships in the British Legation and then began to work for the British. It was he who introduced General Ironside to Reza Khan, and it was Ironside who encouraged Reza Khan to seize power. Educated in Westminster and Kings College, he graduated in 1939 in Political Science and Literature. In 1943 he was sent to India to set up the Radio Delhi programs being broadcast in Persian. In 1945 he was assigned to serve in Bahrain, and after one year was sent to China.

In 1947 he was sent to Tehran to serve as secretary to the first Indian ambassador in Tehran. During the oil nationalization in Iran, he was accorded as assistant to the U.S. ambassador Loy W. Henderson for three years, during which he had a role in the 1953 military coup. As a reward, he was offered a position in the State Department and U.S. citizenship by the U.S. secretary of state for ""his brilliant services to the common cause"". Then he was appointed as liaison officer for Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran.
He became a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1972, shortly after acting as an intermediary in a £100 million arms sale from the United Kingdom to Iran, for which he also received £1 million from the UK Ministry of Defence.[2] In a 1976 bribes trial in London, he was described as ""Mr. Fixit"" and he was said to have received £1 million commission on one arms deal. Shapoor Reporter died of prostate cancer in Argentina in 2005.
